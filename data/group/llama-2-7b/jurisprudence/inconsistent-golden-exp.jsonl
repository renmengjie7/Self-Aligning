This influenced the desire for change and independence in these regions.\n\nAdditionally, the efforts of Nikita Khrushchev, who became the leader of the Soviet Union in 1953, played a significant role in advocating for reform. Khrushchev recognized the need to address the grievances of the people and initiated a series of reforms aimed at improving living conditions, liberalizing aspects of the economy, and reducing the repressive nature of the state. His \"Secret Speech\" in 1956 exposed the crimes committed under Stalin's rule, further highlighting the need for reform.\n\nOverall, the need to stabilize the political situation in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe encompassed a combination of factors such as the shortcomings of the Stalinist model, the influence of imperialist countries, and the efforts of Khrushchev. However, the primary reason for the reform movement was the recognition that in order to avoid further social unrest and maintain political stability, changes needed to be made to address the grievances and demands of the populace."}, "correct": false, "pred": 0, "probs": [0.8320303559303284, 0.06027207896113396, 0.030306704342365265, 0.0773908793926239], "golden_prob": 0.0773908793926239, "pred_prob": 0.8320303559303284, "output": 3}

A steady supply of food and clothing, achieved through successful agricultural production, helped to minimize the risk of famine and social upheaval.\n\nIn summary, the main purpose of attaching importance to agricultural production and protecting the small-scale peasant economy in Chinese feudal dynasties was to ensure the government's financial and military resources by promoting economic stability, fiscal revenue, and maintaining social order."}, "correct": false, "pred": 0, "probs": [0.75232994556427, 0.11537353694438934, 0.04244355112314224, 0.08985300362110138], "golden_prob": 0.08985300362110138, "pred_prob": 0.75232994556427, "output": 3}

This perspective is rooted in the materialistic view of history that Marxism follows.\n\nMarxism argues that the material conditions of society, such as the mode of production and the means of material existence, shape the thoughts, ideas, and beliefs of individuals. In other words, the material conditions of existence determine the nature and content of human thought.\n\nIn this framework, the means of production and the resulting class relations are considered to be the primary factors that shape human thought. The social, economic, and political structures of a society determine the consciousness and ideology of individuals within that society.\n\nThis suggests that thoughts and ideas emerge as a result of the material conditions and social relations in which individuals exist. Therefore, existence is seen as the primary force that influences and shapes human thinking.\n\nIn contrast, Marxist philosophy rejects the idea that thought or consciousness has any independent power to influence or shape material existence. It argues that thoughts and ideas are ultimately derived from the material world and are a reflection of the underlying material conditions.\n\nHence, according to Marxist philosophy, the relationship between thinking and being is that existence, or the material conditions of society, comes first and thought, or consciousness, follows as a product and reflection of those material conditions."}, "correct": false, "pred": 0, "probs": [0.744545578956604, 0.12938262522220612, 0.04759720340371132, 0.07847452163696289], "golden_prob": 0.12938262522220612, "pred_prob": 0.744545578956604, "output": 1}

He believed that the Qing government needed to undergo significant changes to address these challenges effectively. \n\nSun Yat-sen, on the other hand, was a revolutionary who believed that China needed to overthrow the Qing dynasty and establish a new government based on revolutionary principles. He saw revolution as a means to save China from its deteriorating condition. \n\nLastly, Zhang Jian was an industrialist who believed that the development of industries and the modernization of the economy were crucial to saving China from its economic backwardness and ensuring its survival in the face of foreign powers.\n\nWhile the options of overthrowing the Qing government, establishing a constitutional monarchy, or a democratic republic were all potential means to achieve their common goal, the underlying motivation for these choices was ultimately to save the China nation from death or extinction."}, "correct": false, "pred": 3, "probs": [0.11266739666461945, 0.05322030931711197, 0.09942862391471863, 0.7346836924552917], "golden_prob": 0.09942862391471863, "pred_prob": 0.7346836924552917, "output": 2}

Many Chinese intellectuals and reformers saw Japan as a model to emulate and sought ideas and support from Japanese intellectuals and revolutionaries.\n\nSecondly, Tokyo provided a relatively safe and politically tolerant environment for Chinese revolutionaries to gather and organize. The Chinese authorities, under the rule of the Qing Dynasty, exerted strict control over political activities and often suppressed revolutionary movements. Establishing the Tongmenghui in Tokyo allowed the association members to operate in a more conducive environment for their activities.\n\nFurthermore, Tokyo was easily accessible from China, particularly from the southern provinces like Guangdong, where Sun Yat-sen and many other revolutionaries hailed from. The geographical proximity of Tokyo to southern China facilitated travel and communication between the association members and their supporters in China.\n\nOverall, the choice of Tokyo, Japan as the founding place of the China Tongmeng Association was influenced by the desire to seek inspiration and support from Japan's modernization efforts, as well as the need for a safer and more accessible location for the activities of the Chinese revolutionaries."}, "correct": false, "pred": 0, "probs": [0.7019277215003967, 0.15662124752998352, 0.057617735117673874, 0.08383331447839737], "golden_prob": 0.057617735117673874, "pred_prob": 0.7019277215003967, "output": 2}

However, at the Third Plenum, the Chinese leadership acknowledged the need to shift their focus towards economic construction and development. This decision was influenced by the rising global trends of market-oriented economies and the success of other Asian countries, such as Japan and South Korea, in achieving rapid economic growth.\n\nBy shifting the focus to economic construction, the Chinese government adopted a series of policy reforms that promoted economic liberalization, foreign investment, and the modernization of industries. These reforms, collectively known as \"reform and opening up,\" introduced market-oriented practices, encouraged private entrepreneurship, and integrated China into the global economy.\n\nThe change in emphasis towards economic construction had profound implications for the Party's history and the People's Republic of China as a whole. It marked a departure from the ideological rigidity of the past and allowed for more pragmatic and flexible policies to be implemented. This shift resulted in significant improvements in living standards, poverty reduction, and economic growth in China over the following decades.\n\nTherefore, the decision to shift the focus of work to economic construction at the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee is considered the most fundamental reason for the profound turning point in the Party's history since the founding of the People's Republic of China."}, "correct": false, "pred": 3, "probs": [0.19254060089588165, 0.055163804441690445, 0.08026286214590073, 0.6720327138900757], "golden_prob": 0.08026286214590073, "pred_prob": 0.6720327138900757, "output": 2}

He is well-known for his notorious actions and mismanagement, which ultimately led to the downfall of the dynasty. According to historical records, King You indulged in pleasure-seeking activities and neglected state affairs, leading to widespread dissatisfaction among the nobles and officials.\n\nOne of the most significant events during King You's reign was his use of the Signal Tower system. King You would often use the Signal Tower to alert his preferred concubine, Bao Si, of impending attacks by barbarian tribes. However, he abused this system by sending false signals to test people's loyalty and trust. This dishonesty not only eroded trust but also weakened the defenses of the Western Zhou Dynasty.\n\nAs a consequence of his misrule, many states began to revolt against the Western Zhou Dynasty. The most famous rebellion was led by King You's eldest son, Prince Yijiu. With the turmoil caused by the internal conflicts, the Western Zhou Dynasty eventually fell, marking the end of its reign.\n\nTherefore, King You of Zhou is considered the last king of the Western Zhou Dynasty due to his mismanagement, abuse of power, and the subsequent downfall of the dynasty under his rule."}, "correct": false, "pred": 0, "probs": [0.64881432056427, 0.18588842451572418, 0.07748982310295105, 0.08780746906995773], "golden_prob": 0.08780746906995773, "pred_prob": 0.64881432056427, "output": 3}

China's defeat resulted in a series of unequal treaties, which forced the Qing government to make significant concessions to the Western powers.\n\nIn order to adapt to and deal with the Western powers, the Qing government introduced various changes to the bureaucratic system. The establishment of the \"five ministers of Trade,\" \"General Taxation Department,\" and \"Prime Minister Yamen\" were among those changes. These new posts and institutions were aimed at facilitating and regulating trade with the Western powers.\n\nBy creating specialized ministries and departments, the Qing government sought to better manage its dealings with Western nations, particularly in economic matters. The new bureaucratic system was designed to be more responsive to the requirements and practices of Western trade, enabling China to navigate the challenges and complexities posed by the rapidly expanding global economy.\n\nTherefore, the changes in the bureaucratic system were made in response to the need to adapt to and deal with the Western powers.

The industries, such as manufacturing, mining, and energy production, release harmful pollutants into the air and generate massive quantities of solid waste.\n\nSecondly, the management of waste gas and solid waste in China has been insufficient. Inadequate regulations and enforcement, along with a lack of proper waste disposal infrastructure, have contributed to the problem. Many factories and businesses do not adhere to proper waste treatment and disposal practices, leading to pollution of the surrounding environment.\n\nAdditionally, China's increasing population and consumption patterns have contributed to the generation of more waste, exacerbating the problem. The country's large population produces substantial amounts of waste, and the methods to handle and dispose of it have not kept pace with the growing demands.\n\nFurthermore, waste gas and solid waste pollution have severe consequences for public health and the environment. The release of pollutants into the air leads to respiratory problems, cardiovascular issues, and other health concerns for the population. Improper disposal of solid waste pollutes soil, water bodies, and ecosystems, affecting both human and animal life.\n\nOverall, waste gas and solid waste pollution have emerged as the major environmental pollution problem in China due to rapid industrialization, inadequate waste management practices, population growth, and the associated health and environmental consequences."}, "correct": false, "pred": 0, "probs": [0.6274250149726868, 0.1399974524974823, 0.10903012007474899, 0.12354731559753418], "golden_prob": 0.10903012007474899, "pred_prob": 0.6274250149726868, "output": 2}

This treaty was signed in 1940 between the Republic of China and Japan during the Second Sino-Japanese War. Through the treaty, China was forced to give up significant territorial concessions to Japan, which weakened its sovereignty and control over its own lands.\n\nIn the context of the question, viewing China's transformation as an object falling off a cliff implies a decline or regression in its status and power.

The development of these infrastructural facilities not only benefits the migrants but also improves the overall living standards in the original region.\n\n3. Technological advancement: Urban areas often act as hubs for technological advancement and innovation. When people migrate from rural regions to cities, they bring with them diverse knowledge, skills, and experiences. This exchange of ideas and expertise can lead to technological advancements, research, and development, which in turn can benefit the original region and contribute to its overall development.\n\n4. Socio-cultural changes: Rural-urban migration also brings about significant socio-cultural changes in the original region. The exposure to diverse cultures, ideas, and lifestyles in urban areas can influence the social norms, values, and attitudes of the migrants as well as the places they migrate from. This cultural exchange can lead to the adoption of new practices, increased cultural diversity, and the enrichment of social and cultural life in both urban areas and the original region.\n\nOverall, rural-urban migration has the greatest impact on the development of the original region because it brings about economic growth, infrastructure development, technological advancement, and socio-cultural changes, which contribute to overall progress and improvement in living conditions."}, "correct": false, "pred": 0, "probs": [0.5907723307609558, 0.14937064051628113, 0.09059787541627884, 0.16925911605358124], "golden_prob": 0.09059787541627884, "pred_prob": 0.5907723307609558, "output": 2}

{"id": 5242, "question": "\"Two devils are better than a saint\" is an English proverb, which means that even two devils can be friendly and restrain each other, keeping evil to a minimum.

Democratic constitutionalism can effectively limit power.\n\nDemocratic constitutionalism refers to a political system where power is exercised within the framework of a constitution that ensures the protection of individual rights and freedoms, as well as a system of checks and balances. It is based on the principles of democracy, such as popular sovereignty and the rule of law.\n\nOne of the key features of democratic constitutionalism is the effective limitation of power. This means that no single individual or entity, such as a ruler or government, can have unlimited authority or control.

The establishment of the factory security spy agency allowed the emperor to maintain strict supervision over these workshops and ensure their loyalty and efficiency.\n\nBy having a spy agency specifically dedicated to monitoring the factories, the Ming Dynasty was able to strengthen its control over production and prevent any potential rebellions or disruptions in the manufacturing process.

The correct answer is option B, \"Seize the Chinese market and plunder Chinese raw materials.\" \n\nDuring the Opium War (1839-1842), one of the primary reasons for Britain's invasion of China was to protect, expand, and maintain their monopoly on the opium trade. The British were smuggling opium into China, causing widespread addiction and social problems. In response, the Chinese Emperor launched an anti-opium campaign, attempting to crack down on the opium trade and addiction.\n\nThe British, seeing their profitable trade being threatened, launched a military invasion to protect their commercial interests and maintain access to the Chinese market. Their primary goal was to seize control of the Chinese market and exploit China's raw materials, including tea, silk, porcelain, and other commodities.\n\nWhile the Qing government did challenge British actions, it was a response to the British intrusion into Chinese affairs, not the direct cause of the British invasion. Additionally, the answer choice of \"To seize a large part of China\" is too broad and doesn't accurately reflect the specific motives behind Britain's intervention in the Opium War."}, "correct": false, "pred": 1, "probs": [0.23094375431537628, 0.5540052652359009, 0.07497645914554596, 0.1400744616985321], "golden_prob": 0.23094375431537628, "pred_prob": 0.5540052652359009, "output": 0}

{"id": 3082, "question": "The idea which held sway for a long time in feudal China was _____", "choices": ["Legalist thought", "Confucianism", "Taoism thought", "Mohist thought"], "answer": 1, "explanation": "Confucianism was the dominant ideology and ethical system in feudal China for over two millennia. It had a significant impact on various aspects of Chinese society, including politics, education, and social relationships. Confucianism emphasized the importance of moral values and ethics in governing individuals and society. It promoted the idea of virtuous leadership and the cultivation of personal virtues, such as benevolence, filial piety, and righteousness.\n\nIn the context of jurisprudence, Confucianism influenced legal thinking and practice in several ways. Confucian scholars believed that the primary purpose of law was to ensure social order and harmony, rather than to punish or deter crimes. They emphasized the role of education and moral cultivation in preventing wrongdoing, rather than relying solely on legal enforcement.\n\nConfucianism also emphasized the importance of hierarchical relationships and the proper conduct of individuals within their respective roles and positions in society.

Adapted to the transition from slave society to feudal society.\n\nThis is because the statement refers to the death of the Shang king, which implies a change in the ruling system. The Qin Law, however, continued to function even after the change in leadership. This suggests that the law was able to adapt to the new social and political system, which in this case was the transition from a slave society (under the Shang Dynasty) to a feudal society.\n\nDuring this transition, there would have been significant changes in the social and economic structure of the society. Feudalism is characterized by a hierarchical system with a lord or monarch at the top, and various vassals or landowners below them.

To address this trade deficit, Britain sought to find a product that they could sell to the Chinese population in large quantities. They found this product in opium. Opium, which was produced in India (then under British control), became a highly profitable commodity that could address the trade deficit.\n\nHowever, the Chinese government, concerned about the increasing social and health problems caused by widespread opium addiction, decided to crack down on the opium trade. In 1839, Lin Zexu, a Chinese official, confiscated and destroyed British opium shipments in what became known as the \"tiger gate\" incident.\n\nThis action by the Chinese government was seen as a direct threat to British interests.

Durkheim believed that society is a collective entity that is greater than the sum of its individual members. He focused on studying social facts and how they shape individuals' behavior and interactions within society.\n\nDurkheim's perspective on law and jurisprudence was influenced by this sociological approach.

Option C claims that China does not need to learn from the West in building its democratic politics, but again, the question does not provide enough evidence to support this claim. Option D suggests that the \"China model\" has global significance, but the question does not explicitly state this. Therefore, the best answer based on the given information is B. China's democratic political construction is a gradual process."}, "correct": false, "pred": 3, "probs": [0.14357256889343262, 0.2682288587093353, 0.08708115667104721, 0.501117467880249], "golden_prob": 0.2682288587093353, "pred_prob": 0.501117467880249, "output": 1}
