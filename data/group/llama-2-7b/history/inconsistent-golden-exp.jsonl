The US implemented policies like containment, which aimed to prevent the spread of communism. This led to conflicts and tensions in various regions, such as the Berlin Blockade and the Korean War, which again created a need for political stability in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.\n\nFurthermore, the efforts of Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev played a significant role in pushing for reform. As the successor of Stalin, Khrushchev sought to distance himself from the harsh policies of his predecessor. He initiated the process of de-Stalinization, which involved denouncing Stalin's cult of personality and easing some of the oppressive policies. This reform movement aimed to address the internal problems within the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe and stabilize their political situations.\n\nOverall, the need to stabilize the political situation in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe arose from a combination of factors, including the shortcomings of the Stalinist model, the influence of imperialist countries, and the efforts of Khrushchev to address internal issues."}, "correct": false, "pred": 0, "probs": [0.7557410597801208, 0.07029487192630768, 0.04263599216938019, 0.13132810592651367], "golden_prob": 0.13132810592651367, "pred_prob": 0.7557410597801208, "output": 3}

During this time, Western capitalist countries, particularly Britain, sought to expand their trade with China. However, China had strict regulations on foreign trade and limited access to its markets.\n\nBritain, in particular, had a large trade imbalance with China. They were importing large quantities of Chinese goods like tea and silk, but their exports to China, such as British manufactured goods, were limited. British traders saw the potential of the Chinese market and desired to establish better access to it.\n\nOne of the tactics used by Britain and other Western powers was the opium trade. Opium was grown and produced in British-controlled India and then smuggled into China. This illegal trade created a massive addiction problem in China, and it severely impacted Chinese society and economy.

During this time, Western capitalist countries, particularly Britain, sought to expand their trade with China. However, China had strict regulations on foreign trade and limited access to its markets.\n\nBritain, in particular, had a large trade imbalance with China. They were importing large quantities of Chinese goods like tea and silk, but their exports to China, such as British manufactured goods, were limited. British traders saw the potential of the Chinese market and desired to establish better access to it.\n\nOne of the tactics used by Britain and other Western powers was the opium trade. Opium was grown and produced in British-controlled India and then smuggled into China. This illegal trade created a massive addiction problem in China, and it severely impacted Chinese society and economy.

As the bourgeoisie gained wealth and power, they aspired to establish a new social order independent of the Church. However, they were hesitant to break away from the ideologies and teachings that had dominated society for centuries. Therefore, their artworks continued to reflect biblical themes, showing their reluctance to completely abandon the ideological influence of the church.\n\nIt is important to note that the answer C. \"They are not against the Catholic Church\" is not completely accurate. While the bourgeoisie may not have been openly against the Catholic Church, their hesitancy to break free from the ideological shackles of the church implies a certain level of disagreement or resistance to being completely aligned with the Church's teachings."}, "correct": false, "pred": 3, "probs": [0.20323291420936584, 0.07476521283388138, 0.09600044041872025, 0.6260014772415161], "golden_prob": 0.20323291420936584, "pred_prob": 0.6260014772415161, "output": 0}

{"id": 758, "question": "The first Western colonial power to occupy Chinese territory was _____", "choices": ["Britain", "Spain", "Holland", "Portugal"], "answer": 3, "explanation": "Portugal was the first Western colonial power to occupy Chinese territory because of its early expeditions and establishment of trading posts in the region. In the early 16th century, Portuguese explorer and navigator Vasco da Gama successfully sailed around the Cape of Good Hope and reached India, establishing a direct sea route to Asia. This maritime achievement prompted Portugal to venture further east and establish a presence in China.\n\nIn 1513, Portuguese diplomat and explorer Jorge Álvares arrived in China and established the first Portuguese trade settlement on the island of Tamão (present-day Macau).

It involved transforming China's society and economy to be based on socialist principles, such as collective ownership of land and means of production, and the promotion of social equality. \n\nTherefore, the essay title \"I live in a happy age\" likely refers to the perceived positive outcomes of these reforms and the establishment of a socialist system. These changes would have been presented as bringing happiness and prosperity to the people, at least according to the official narrative of the Chinese Communist Party during that time."}, "correct": false, "pred": 3, "probs": [0.26249945163726807, 0.09656815230846405, 0.08522109687328339, 0.5557113289833069], "golden_prob": 0.09656815230846405, "pred_prob": 0.5557113289833069, "output": 1}

It also opened up opportunities for rural entrepreneurship and private farming, promoting economic development in the countryside.\n\nOverall, the implementation of the household contract responsibility system was a significant step in China's reform and opening-up policies, helping to improve the living standards of peasants and contribute to the country's economic growth."}, "correct": false, "pred": 0, "probs": [0.5364816188812256, 0.13564379513263702, 0.15370456874370575, 0.17417007684707642], "golden_prob": 0.15370456874370575, "pred_prob": 0.5364816188812256, "output": 2}

These propositions included universal suffrage, secret elections, and the abolition of property qualifications for parliamentary candidates.\n\nThe answer \"It is not yet out of the category of the bourgeois-democratic revolution\" is correct because the Chartist movement's demands align with the principles of bourgeois democracy. Bourgeois democracy refers to a system in which political power is vested in the hands of the bourgeoisie, the capitalist class, and includes concepts such as universal suffrage and equality under the law.\n\nThe Chartist movement sought to extend these bourgeois democratic principles to a broader section of society by advocating for universal suffrage and the elimination of property qualifications for parliamentary candidates.

However, the emperors of this dynasty sought to centralize authority and maintain absolute control over the government.

They adhered to a closed-door policy, limiting trade with other nations, including Britain.

This occurred during the late 19th and early 20th centuries when China was weakened due to internal conflicts, Western imperialism, and unequal treaties that were forced upon the country.\n\nThe eight-nation allied forces consisted of troops from various Western powers, including the United States, United Kingdom, Japan, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, and Austria-Hungary. They invaded China in 1900 during the Boxer Rebellion, a nationalist uprising against foreign influences and imperialism.\n\nThe Boxer Rebellion was a significant event in Chinese history as it aimed to remove foreign powers and influence from China. However, the rebellion was suppressed, and the arrival of the eight-nation allied forces further demonstrated China's vulnerability and inability to resist foreign intervention.\n\nThe capture of Beijing by the eight-nation allied forces marked a turning point in Chinese history. It showcased the extent of foreign dominance and control over China's political, economic, and social affairs. This event solidified the establishment of the semi-colonial and semi-feudal ruling order, where China was effectively dominated and exploited by foreign powers.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is \"The eight-nation allied forces captured Beijing\" because it represents the culmination of China's subjugation to foreign powers and the establishment of a semi-colonial and semi-feudal ruling order in Chinese society."}, "correct": false, "pred": 3, "probs": [0.27012646198272705, 0.11260545998811722, 0.11260545998811722, 0.5046626329421997], "golden_prob": 0.11260545998811722, "pred_prob": 0.5046626329421997, "output": 2}
