Via hematogenous or lymphatic route\n2. Via direct spread from persistent pyriform sinus fistulae or thyroglossal duct cysts\n3. As a result of penetrating trauma\n4. Due to immunosuppression\n• Streptococcus and anaerobes account for about 70% of cases.\n• In children and young adults, MC cause is presence of a pyriform sinus (remnant of the fourth branchial pouch that connects the oropharynx with thyroid), such sinuses are predominantly left-sided.\n• Long-standing goiter and degeneration in thyroid malignancy are risk factors in elderly.\nClinical Features\n• Thyroid pain, often referred to the throat or ears, and a small, tender goiter.\n• Fever, dysphagia and erythema over the thyroid.\n• Systemic symptoms of a febrile illness and lymphadenopathy.\n• Complications such as systemic sepsis, tracheal or esophageal rupture, jugular vein thrombosis, laryngeal chondritis, and perichondritis or sympathetic trunk paralysis may also occur.\nDiagnosis\n• ESR and WBC count are usually increased, but thyroid function is normal.\n• FNA biopsy shows infiltration by polymorphonuclear leukocytes.\n• Culture of the sample can identify the organism.\n• Persistent pyriform sinus fistula should be suspected in children with recurrent acute thyroiditis. A barium swallow demonstrates the anomalous tract with 80% sensitivity.\nTreatment\n• Parenteral antibiotics and drainage of abscesses.\n• Patients with pyriform sinus fistulae require complete resection of the sinus tract, including the area of the thyroid where the tract terminates, to prevent recurrence.", "cop": 3, "opa": "Acute thyroiditis", "opb": "Thyroglossal cyst", "opc": "Sub acute thyroiditis", "opd": "Toxic goiter", "subject_name": "Surgery", "topic_name": null, "id": "a8f94c80-04ea-4319-bb88-c28d33a26269", "choice_type": "single"}, "correct": false, "pred": 1, "probs": [0.03031054139137268, 0.8858038783073425, 0.060279712080955505, 0.023605873808264732], "golden_prob": 0.060279712080955505, "pred_prob": 0.8858038783073425, "output": 2}

However, bone pain, swelling, and tenderness are common presentations in symptomatic patients. Endocrine disturbances may be the initial presentation in some patients. This section will briefly review the common affected locations of fibrous dysplasia, fibrous dysplasia deformity and fracture, and malignant transformation for this lesion. Affected locations The most common sites of skeletal involvement in monostotic fibrous dysplasia are the ribs, proximal femur, and craniofacial bones, typically the posterior maxilla. The lesion may involve only a small segment of bone or it may occupy its entire length. In polyostotic fibrous dysplasia, the spectrum of involvement varies from 2 bones to more than 75% of the skeleton. Polyostotic fibrous dysplasia is most commonly found in the femur, tibia, pelvis, and foot. Other sites less commonly affected include the ribs, skull, and bones of the upper extremity. Uncommonly affected bones include the lumbar spine, clavicle, and the cervical spine. Deformity and fracture The most common physical deformities are leg-length discrepancy, facial asymmetry due to hemicranial involvement, and rib deformities. Fracture is the most common complication in fibrous dysplasia. It is seen in more than half of the patients with the polyostotic form of the disease. Deformities in weight-bearing bones can occur.

However, most atypical mycobacteria are not inhibited by INH. The most plausible mechanism of action of INH is inhibition of synthesis of mycolic acids which are unique fatty acid component of mycobacterial cell wall. This may explain the high selectivity of INH for mycobacteria (it is not active against any other microorganism). The lipid content of mycobacteria exposed to INH is reduced. A gene labelled inh A which encodes for a fatty acid synthase enzyme is the target of INH action. Adverse effects INH is well tolerated by most patients. Peripheral neuritis and a variety of neurological manifestations (paresthesias, numbness, mental disturbances, rarely convulsions) are the most impoant dose-dependent toxic effects.

Granulomatous arteritis is the most characteristic of anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody (ANCA)-associated granulomatous vasculitis, which often involves the kidney but typically involves the lung and other organs. Hyaline arteriolosclerosis is seen with long-standing essential hypertension of moderate severity. These lesions give rise to benign nephrosclerosis. The affected kidneys become symmetrically shrunken and granular because of progressive loss of renal parenchyma and consequent fine scarring. Polyarteritis nodosa produces a vasculitis that can involve the kidney.", "cop": 4, "opa": "Fibromuscular dysplasia", "opb": "Granulomatous arteritis", "opc": "Renal arterial stenosis", "opd": "Necrotizing arteriolitis", "subject_name": "Pathology", "topic_name": "Blood Vessels", "id": "5c0f5ecf-0e3b-4e6a-bce6-073b04e37e88", "choice_type": "single"}, "correct": false, "pred": 2, "probs": [0.09062736481428146, 0.07997836172580719, 0.7588136196136475, 0.07058066129684448], "golden_prob": 0.07058066129684448, "pred_prob": 0.7588136196136475, "output": 3}

{"id": 123161, "question": "Hormone acting on nuclear receptors", "choices": ["Calcitonin", "Thyroxine", "Glucocoicoids", "Vasopressine"], "answer": 1, "explanation": "Thyroid Hormones Increase Gene Transcription in the Cell Nucleus The thyroid hormones thyroxine and triiodothyronine cause increased transcription by specific genes in the nucleus. To accomplish this, these hormones first bind directly with receptor proteins in the nucleus; these recep- tors are activated transcription factors located within the chromosomal complex, and they control the function of the gene promoters, as explained in Chapter 3. Two impoant features of thyroid hormone function in the nucleus are the following: 1. They activate the genetic mechanisms for the forma- tion of many types of intracellular proteins--probably 100 or more. Many of these are enzymes that promote enhanced intracellular metabolic activity in viually all cells of the body. 2. Once bound to the intranuclear receptors, the thyroid hormones can continue to express their control functions for days or even weeks. Hormones That Act Mainly on the Genetic Machinery of the Cell Steroid Hormones Increase Protein Synthesis Another means by which hormones act--specifically, the steroid hormones secreted by the adrenal coex, ovaries, and testes--is to cause synthesis of proteins in the target cells. These proteins then function as enzymes, transpo proteins, or structural proteins, which in turn provide other functions of the cells. The sequence of events in steroid function is essen- tially the following: 1. The steroid hormone diffuses across the cell membrane and enters the cytoplasm of the cell, where it binds with a specific receptor protein. 2. The combined receptor protein-hormone then diffuses into or is transpoed into the nucleus. 3. The combination binds at specific points on the DNA strands in the chromosomes, which activates the tran- scription process of specific genes to form mRNA. 4. The mRNA diffuses into the cytoplasm, where it pro- motes the translation process at the ribosomes to form new proteins. To give an example, aldosterone, one of the hormones secreted by the adrenal coex, enters the cytoplasm of renal tubular cells, which contain a specific receptor protein often called the mineralocoicoid receptor. Therefore, in these cells, the sequence of events cited earlier ensues. After about 45 minutes, proteins begin to appear in the renal tubular cells and promote sodium reabsorption from the tubules and potassium secretion into the tubules. Thus, the full action of the steroid hormone is characteristically delayed for at least 45 minutes--up to several hours or even days. This is in marked contrast to the almost instantaneous action of some of the peptide and amino acid-derived hormones, such as vasopressin and norepinephrine.

A: Schizont P. falciparum differs from the other forms of malarial parasites in that developing erythrocytic schizonts aggregate in the capillaries of the brain and other internal organs, so that only young ring forms are found in peripheral blood Life cycle of all Plasmodium species Infection in humans begins with the bite of an infected female Anopheline mosquito. Sporozoites are the infective form of the parasite, present in the salivary glands of the female anopheles mosquito. Sporozoites released from the salivary glands of the mosquito enter the bloodstream during feeding, quickly invading liver cells (hepatocytes). Sporozoites are cleared from the circulation within 30 minutes. During the next 14 days in the case of P. falciparum, the liver-stage parasites differentiate and undergo asexual multiplication resulting in tens of thousands of merozoites which burst from the hepatoctye. Individual merozoites invade red blood cells (erythrocytes) and undergo an additional round of multiplication producing 12-16 merozoites within a schizont. The length of this erythrocytic stage of the parasite life cycle depends on the parasite species: - Irregular cycle for P. falciparum, - 48 hours for P. vivax, and P. ovale and - 72 hours for P. malariae. The clinical manifestations of malaria, fever and chills, are associated with the synchronous rupture of the infected erythrocyte. The released merozoites go on to invade additional erythrocytes. Not all of the merozoites divide into schizonts, some differentiate into sexual forms, male and female gametocytes. These gametocytes are taken up by a female anophylean mosquito during a blood meal. Within the mosquito midgut, the male gametocyte undergoes a rapid nuclear division, producing 8 flagellated microgametes which feilize the female macrogamete. The resulting ookinete traverses the mosquito gut wall and encysts on the exterior of the gut wall as a oocyst. Soon the oocyst ruptures, releasing hundreds of sporozoites into the mosquito body cavity where they eventually migrate to the mosquito salivary gland. To diagnose malaria and determine which species of Plasmodium is causing the infection, blood film is examined. Each species has distinctive physical characteristics that are apparent under a microscope. In P. falciparum, only early (ring-form) trophozoites and gametocytes are seen in the peripheral blood. It is unusual to see mature trophozoites or schizonts in peripheral blood smears as these are usually sequestered in the tissues. The parasitised erythrocytes are not enlarged, and it is common to see cells with more than one parasite within them (multiply parasitised erythrocytes). On occasion, faint comma-shaped red dots called \"Maurer's dots\" are seen on the red cell surface. The comma-shaped dots can also appear as pear-shaped blotches. Plasmodium falciparum causes severe malaria a distinctive propey not shared by any other human malaria, that of sequestration. Within the 48-hour asexual blood stage cycle, the mature forms change the surface propeies of infected red blood cells causing them to stick to blood vessels (a process called cytoadherence). This leads to obstruction of the microcirculation and results in dysfunction of multiple organs, typically the brain in cerebral malaria.", "raw": {"question": "Stage of falciparum not seen in peripheral blood smear: March 2011", "exp": "Ans.

Infection is acquired by the consumption of oocysts, after which the parasite invades intestinal epithelial cells and undergoes both sexual and asexual cycles of development.

One ofthese conditions is systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE or lupus), a relatively common chronic autoimmune disease that predominantly affects women of child-bearing age. When this inflammation occurs in the lupus patient it is accompanied as expected by a marked increase in ESR. However in contrst to most other inflammatory condition, the plasma CRP remains resolutely normal. The combination of raised ESR and normal CRP is a useful diagnostic feature of SLE. Other disorders where CRP is not increased Osteoahritis, leukemia, anemia Polycythemia, viral infection Ulcerative colitis, pregnancy, estrogen", "cop": 2, "opa": "RA", "opb": "SLE", "opc": "Scleroderma", "opd": "Polymyalgia rheumatica", "subject_name": "Medicine", "topic_name": null, "id": "87dfebfe-ae29-4d3b-be22-451e45313c96", "choice_type": "single"}, "correct": false, "pred": 3, "probs": [0.1080544963479042, 0.1476929783821106, 0.12244178354740143, 0.6218106746673584], "golden_prob": 0.1476929783821106, "pred_prob": 0.6218106746673584, "output": 1}

They can be considered as an alternative to a traditional supply where no reliable liquid oxygen supply is available, such as an off-shore site or a site where the safety criteria for liquid installations cannot be met. These devices can be small, designed to supply oxygen to a single patient or they can be large enough to supply oxygen for a medical gas pipeline system. The components of this system are: Duplex compressors and molecular sieves, receivers, dryers, vacuum pumps, filters, line pressure regulators, control system, oxygen performance monitoring system and back up cylinder manifold. Oxygen concentrators operate on the principle of adsorbing (under pressure) other gases in the atmosphere onto the surface of an adsorbent material, known as zeolite. Because oxygen is not adsorbed by the zeolite, it is free to pass through into the storage for use. Zeolite is hydrated aluminium silicates of the alkaline eah metals in a powder or granular form. The zeolite is sealed in a vessel known as sieve bed. The sieve beds operate in pairs, one adsorbs whilst the other regenerates. Ambient air is filtered and pressurised to about 137 kPa by a compressor and then exposed to a zeolite molecular sieve column, forming a very large surface area, at a ceain pressure. The sieve selectively retains nitrogen and other unwanted components of air. These are released into the atmosphere after heating the column and applying a vacuum. The changeover between the columns is made by a time switch. The process is capable of producing oxygen concentrations of about 95%. The remainder is made up of mainly argon with a small percentage of nitrogen. During closed circuit anaesthesia, argon accumulation could occur. Therefore, to avoid this, higher fresh gas flows are required. As the process generates a great deal of heat, hence ventilation and cooling are mandatory. If the plant fails, the emergency cylinder manifold will feed into the pipeline at higher concentrations (99.5%) than the plant's operating norm of 95%. This may have an effect on down line equipment, paicularly in the critical care areas. This low-flow (2-4 L/min), low-pressure system can provide continuous oxygen to the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients.

B. anthracis was the first bacterial pathogen described by Koch and the model pathogen for 'Koch's postulates' (see Box 6.1, p. 100). It is a Gram-positive organism with a central spore. The spores can survive for years in soil. Infection is commonly acquired from contact with animals, paicularly herbivores. The ease of production of B. anthracis spores makes this infection a candidate for biological warfare or bioterrorism. B. anthracis produces a number of toxins that mediate the clinical features of disease. The simple polychrome methylene blue (PMB) staining procedure for blood or tissue smears from dead animals (M'Fadyean reaction) established in 1903 remained accepted as a highly reliable, rapid diagnostic test for anthrax for six decades while that disease was still common in livestock throughout the world. Improvements in disease control led to anthrax becoming rare in industrialized countries and less frequent in developing countries with the result that quality controlled, commercially produced PMB became hard to obtain by the 1980s. Mixed results with alternative methylene blue-based stains then led to diagnosis failures, confusion among practitioners and mistrust of this procedure as a reliable test for anthrax.

These are the hormones responsible for actions like bradycardia and tachycardia by acting on their specific receptors.* Systolic blood pressure (SBP) is determined by cardiac output (b1 action,). b1 receptors are present on heart which upon stimulation causes tachycardia.* Diastolic BP (DBP) depends on the state of blood vessels. b2 receptors are present on blood vessels which upon stimulation causes vasodilation - DBP |* Alpha receptors are present on vessel wall, which upon stimulation constricts vessel wall and increase total peripheral resistance - DBP |* Increased DBP stimulates baroreceptor mediated release of ACh (reflex action) that decreases heart rate via activation of M2 receptors.* Reduction in DBP increases central sympathetic outflow and thereby increases heart rate.* NOTE: NA normally decreases heart rate but if given after a dose of atropine, increase in heart rate will be seen (reflex action is abolished because of blockage of M2 receptor).* Adrenaline acts on al, a2, b1, b2 receptors whereas Noradrenaline acts on al, a2, b1.

{"id": 45887, "question": "Which drug is not used to prevent contrastnephropathy aEUR'", "choices": ["Fenoldopam", "N-acetylcysteine", "Infusion of Hair normal saline", "Hemodialysis"], "answer": 0, "explanation": "Fenoldopam The administration of radiocontrast media can lead to a usually reversible form of acute kidney injury (formerly called acute renal failure) that begins soon after the contrast is administered. In most cases, there are no permanent sequelae, but there is some evidence that its development is associated with adverse outcomes. Prevention There is no specific treatment once contrast-induced acute renal failure develops, and management must be as ,for any cause of acute tubular necrosis, with the focus on maintaining fluid and electrolyte balance. The best treatment of contrast-induced renal failure is prevention. A variety of preventive measures may reduce the risk of contras nephropathv. Types of radiocontrast agents Iodinated radiocontrast agents are either ionic or nonionic and, at the concentrations required for aeriography or computed tomography, are of variable osmolality: First generation agents are ionic monomers; they are highly hyperosmolal (approximately 1400 to 1800 mosmol/kg) compared with the osmolality of plasma. Second generation agents, such as iohexol, are nonionic monomers with a lower osmolality than the first generation radiocontrast media. - The newest nonionic contrast agents are isoosmolal. These isoosmolal agents have a lower osmolality than \"low osniolal\" second generation drugs. The iso-osnzolal nonionic contrast agent iodixanol appears to reduce the risk of contrast nephropathy in high-risk patients, such as diabetic patients with renal insufficiency, compared to the low osmolal nonionic agent iohexol, but not when compared to other low osnzolal nonionic agents. -However, additional randomized prospective trials comparing iodixanol (or other iso-osmolal agents if developed) to other low osmolal ionic or nonionic agents are required before it can be determined that isoosmolal contrast agents are uniformly less nephrotoxic than low osmolal agents as a class, especially given the substantially greater expense of the only currently available iso-osmolal nonionic agent, iodixanol. Hydration, mantilla, and diuretics Hydration is beneficial, and the type of hydration solution may be impoant. In comparison, the role of diuretics, mannitol and other renal vasodilators in this setting is unceain. Diuretics Several small trials have investigated the effect of diuretics. In one trial, 78 patients with stable chronic renal failure (mean plasma creatinine concentration 2.1 ing/dL or >25 percent, measured 2 to 5 days after the procedure) occurred less frequently among patients who received iloprost compared to placebo (8 versus 22 percent respectively). - Severe hypotension required withdrawal of Iloprost in three patients. Although Iloprost may be effective in the prevention of contrast nephropathy, confirmation of these results in larger definitive trials is necessary before its use can be recommended. Fetzoldopanz - A prospective randomized trial (CONTRAST) assessed the effectiveness of fenoldopam in 315 patients (one-half diabetic) undergoing a cardiovascular procedure who had chronic renal .failure with an estimated creatinine clearance below 60 mllmin (mean 29 m1/min with a mean serum creatinine of 1.8 mg/dL ). - All patients also received one-half normal saline as mentioned above, and contrast nephropathy was defined as an increase in serum creatinine of ?..25 percent above baseline in the first four days. - There was no reduction in the incidence of contrast nephropathy in the fenoldopam group (34 versus 30 percent with placebo). It has been proposed that direct intrarenal administration may be more beneficial. Endothelia: receptor antagonist - A nonselective endothelin receptor antagonist was tested in a multicenter, double-blind randomized trial of high-risk patients undergoing coronary angiography. Compared with those assigned to placebo, a significantly higher percentage of patients who received active therapy sustained contrast nephropathy (56 versus 29 percent); this observation raises the possibility that endothelin may actually provide an intrinsic protective effect rather than contributing to the development of acute renal failure. Alternatively, selective endothelin receptor antagonists may be required to demonstrate prophylactic value in this setting. Summary And Recommendations Optimal therapy to prevent contrast-induced acute renal failure remains unceain. Patients with near-normal renal function are at little risk and,few precautions are necessary other than avoidance of volume depletion. We recommend the following preventive measures for patients at increased risk of contrast nephropathy, which is defined a serum creatinine 1.5 mg/d1. (132 tnicromol/L) or an estimated glomerular filtration rate <60 ml/1.73 m2, Use, if -possible, ultrasonography, MRI without gadolinium contrast, or CT scanning without radiocontrast agents. We recommend NOT using high osmolul agents. We recommend the use of iodixanol or nonionic low osmolal agents such as iopamidol or ioversol rather than iohexol. Use lower doses of contrast and avoid repetitive, closely spaced studies. Avoid volume depletion and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. If there are no contraindications to volume expansion, we recommend isotonic intravenous fluids prior to and continued for several hours after contrast administration. The optimal type of fluid and timing of administration are not well established. We suggest isotonic bicarbonate rather than isotonic saline. Despite conflicting data, we suggest that acetylcysteine be administered the day before and the day of the procedure, based upon its potential .for benefit and low toxicity and cost. If acetylcysteine is administered, we suggest giving 1200 mg orally twice daily rather than 600 mg twice daily the day before and the day of the procedure. Based upon the lack of convincing evidence of benefit and the potential risk of anaphylactoid reactions, we suggest not using intravenous acetylcysteine for the prevention of contrast nephropathy. (Note: Oral acetylcysteine is used.) We recommend NOT using mannitol or other diuretics prophylactically. Among patients with stage 3 and 4 CKD, we recommend NOT performing prophylactic hemofiltration or hemodialysis after contrast exposure.

It consists of both epithelial and lymphoid elements thus known as adenolymphoma (probably arises from remnants of parotid tissue trapped in lymphnodes within the parotid gland). Also known as papillary cystadenoma lymphomatosum. The tumor arises only in the parotid gland. Almost always arises in the lower poion of the parotid gland overlying the angle of mandible. Common in males. (Occurs most often in older white men) Age : 5th to 7th decade. Association is seen with smoking. Bilaterality is seen in 10% cases. Its well encapsulated, extremely slow growing tumor, never turns malignant. A peculiar feature of Wahins tumor is that it shows 'hot' spot in 99' Tc-peechnate scan. Other tumors of the parotid show 'cold' spot (Oncocytomas another benign parotid tumor also shows hot spot). (Because of the high mitochondrial content within oncocytes, the oncocyte-rich Wahin tumor and Oncocytomas incorporate technetium Tc 99m and appear as hot spots on radionuclide scans.)

It consists of both epithelial and lymphoid elements thus known as adenolymphoma (probably arises from remnants of parotid tissue trapped in lymphnodes within the parotid gland). Also known as papillary cystadenoma lymphomatosum. The tumor arises only in the parotid gland. Almost always arises in the lower poion of the parotid gland overlying the angle of mandible. Common in males. (Occurs most often in older white men) Age : 5th to 7th decade. Association is seen with smoking. Bilaterality is seen in 10% cases. Its well encapsulated, extremely slow growing tumor, never turns malignant. A peculiar feature of Wahins tumor is that it shows 'hot' spot in 99' Tc-peechnate scan. Other tumors of the parotid show 'cold' spot (Oncocytomas another benign parotid tumor also shows hot spot). (Because of the high mitochondrial content within oncocytes, the oncocyte-rich Wahin tumor and Oncocytomas incorporate technetium Tc 99m and appear as hot spots on radionuclide scans.)

This leads to disruption of the mitotic spindle apparatus and results in metaphase arrest since the chromosomes are unable to segregate. Since these drugs interfere with mitosis, they are considered cell-cycle specific for the M phase. Cytarabine belongs to the class of antineoplastics that are antimetabolites. This drug class interferes with normal metabolic pathways by competing for enzymatic sites. Specifically, cytarabine (Ara-C) is a pyrimidine nucleoside analog. It interrupts DNA synthesis and function by inhibiting DNA polymerase and incorporating into the DNA or RNA of the cell. As you would expect, this drug is cell-cycle specific for the S phase. Daunorubicin is one of the antibiotic antineoplastic agents (others include dactinomycin, doxorubicin, bleomycin, plicamycin, and mitomycin). These agents work by disrupting DNA functioning. Daunorubicin binds to DNA between base pairs on adjacent strands, resulting in uncoiling of the helix and destruction of the DNA template.

The incidence of rigidity noted with opioid anesthetic techniques varies significantly because of differences in dose and speed of opioid administration, the concomitant use of N2O, the presence or absence of muscle relaxants, and the patient's age. Opioid-induced rigidity is characterized by increased muscle tone that sometimes progresses to severe stiffness with the potential for serious problems. Clinically significant opioid-induced rigidity usually begins just as or after a patient loses consciousness. Mild manifestations of rigidity, such as hoarseness, can occur in conscious patients. Vocal cord closure is primarily responsible for the difficult ventilation with a bag and mask that follows the administration of opioids. The precise mechanism by which opioids cause muscle rigidity is not clearly understood. Muscle rigidity is not the result of a direct action on muscle fibers because it can be decreased or prevented by pretreatment with muscle relaxants. Mechanisms of opioid-induced muscle rigidity involving the CNS have been postulated. Pharmacologic investigation using selective agonists and antagonists suggest that systemic opioid-induced muscle rigidity is primarily caused by activation of central m receptors, whereas supraspinal d1 and k1 receptors may attenuate this effect. Some aspects of opioid-induced catatonia and rigidity (increased incidence with age, muscle movements resembling extrapyramidal side effects) are similar to Parkinson's disease and suggest similarities in neurochemical mechanisms.

It is treated with intramuscular ceftriaxone, oral trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, or oral erythromycin often results in healing in 2 weeks.

Normally the immune system does not show any reactivity to self antigen. They are able to discriminate between foreign antigen and host cell. This is called immune tolerance or self tolerance How does immune tolerance develop? The immune system removes cells which show self reactivity to antigens. The process of removing these cells is broadly classified into two categories. a) Central tolerance b) Peripheral tolerance a) Central tolerance The premature lymphocytes which are self reactive are killed in the central organs i.e. organs where they mature (i.e. Bone marrow in case of B lymphocytes and Thymus in case of T lymphocytes) This process is called central deletion or negative selection i.e. the process which does not allow self reactive cells to grow. Sometimes instead of killing the self reactive cells only their receptors are deleted, this is called central editing or receptor editing. b) Peripheral tolerance Central tolerance is not able to kill all the premature self reactive cells. Some cells escape central tolerance; they mature and move out in the peripheral lymphoid system. The mechanism by which these cells are inactivated or removed in the peripheral lymphoid system is called peripheral tolerance. There are five main mechanisms operating in peripheral tolerance, these are : i) Anergy This refers to prolonged or irreversible functional inactivation of self reactive lymphocytes ii) Suppression by regulatory T cells Sometimes regulatory cells are present to suppress the self reactive T lymphocytes iii) Clonal deletion by activation induced cell death Self reactive lymphocytes receive signals that promote their death by apoptosis iv) Antigen Sequestration Some self reactive lymphocytes cannot react against the host cells because these cells or antigens are located in the tissues which do not communicate with blood e.g. testis, eye, and brain. These sites are called immune privileged sites, because it is difficult to induce immune response to antigen in these sites. v) Cytokine activation So, these are the layers of self tolerance for an autoimmune disease to develop in the body, these layers of self tolerance should be disrupted or bypassed. Mechanism of development of Autoimmunity 1. Exogenous a) Molecular mimicry - Cross reactivity between a microbial product and a self antigen might lead to activation of autoreactive lymphocytes. b) Superantigenic stimulation - Microbial superantigens, such as staphylococcal protein 'A' and enterotoxin, can stimulate a broad range of T and B cells irresepetive of their antigen specificity. c) Microbial adj uvanticity - Infectious agent may be able to overcome self tolerance because they possess molecules, such as bacterial endotoxin, that have adjuvant like effect which enhances immunogenicity of autoantigen. 2. Endogenous A. Altered antigen presention a) Loss of immunologic privilege - If the privileged site are damaged by trauma or inflammation, the sequestrated autoantigens (lens, brain protein) communicate with blood and lead to activation of autoreactive lymphocytes. b) Presentation of Cryptic epitopes (option b) - Protein determinants (eiptopes) of an antigen is not routinely seen by lymphocytes (cryptotic epitopes) are recognized as a result of immunologic reactivity to associated molecules. Infections may release and damage self antigen and expose epitopes of this antigen that are normally concealed from immune system, i.e., cryptic epitopes. c) Alteration of self antigen - Inflammation of drug exposure may cause a primary chemical alteration in proteins which may be recognized as autoantigen. d) Enhanced function of antigen presenting cells by costimulatory molecular expression and cytokine production may cause autoimmunity. Increased T cell help - Intese stimulation of T-cells can produce nonspecific signals that bypass the need for antigen-specific helper T cells and lead to polyclonal B cell activation with formation of multiple autoantibodies. Increased B cell function - Nonspecific stimulation of polyclonal B cell by B cell activators, such as bacterial endotoxin, may also lead to production of autoantibodies. Apoptotic defect - Clones of cells that had immunological reactivity with self antigen are eliminated during embryonic life by apoptosis. Such clones are called \"forbedden clones\". This negative selection of autoreactive T cells in the thymus requires expression of the autoimmune regular (AIRE) gene that enables the expression of tissue specific proteins of tissue specific ptoeins in thymic medullary cells. Peptides from these proteins are expressed in context of MHC molecules and mediate the elimination of autoreactive T cells. The absence of AIRE gene interferes expression of proteins in context MHC molecules and leads to failure of negative selection of autoreactive T cells.
