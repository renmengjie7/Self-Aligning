{"id": 38722, "question": "Maple syrup urine disease can be caused by a problem with the metabolism of which particular compound.", "choices": ["Glycogen", "Collagen", "Dopamine", "Valine"], "answer": 3, "explanation": "Some amino acids (isoleucine, tryptophan, phenylalanine, and tyrosine) are both glucogenic and ketogenic because their degradation pathway forms multiple products.a. Amino acids that are converted to pyruvate (see Figure I).(1). The amino acids that are synthesized from the intermediates of glycolysis (serine, glycine, cysteine, and alanine) are degraded to form pyruvate.(a). Serine is converted to 2-phosphoglycerate, an intermediate of glycolysis, or directly to pyruvate and NH4+ by serine dehydratase, an enzyme that requires PLP.(b). Glycine, in a reversal of the reaction utilized for its synthesis, reacts with methylene-FH4 to form serine.1. Glycine also reacts with FH4 and NAD+ to produce CO2 and NH4+ (glycine cleavage enzyme).2. Glycine can be converted to glyoxylate, which can be oxidized to CO2 and H2 O or converted to oxalate.(c). Cysteine forms pyruvate. Its sulfur, which was derived from methionine, is converted to H2 SO4 , which is excreted by the kidneys.(d). Alanine can be transaminated to pyruvate.b. Amino acids that are converted to intermediates of the TCA cycle (see Figure II).(1). The carbons from the four groups of amino acids form the TCA cycle intermediates: a-ketoglutarate, succinyl-CoA, fumarate, and oxaloacetate.(a). Amino acids that form a-ketoglutarate (see Figure III).1. Glutamate can be deaminated by glutamate dehydrogenase or transaminated to form a- ketoglutarate.2. Glutamine is converted by glutaminase to glutamate with the release of its amide nitrogen as NH4+ 3. Proline is oxidized so that its ring opens, forming glutamate semialdehyde, which is oxidized to glutamate.4. Arginine is cleaved by arginase in the liver to form urea and ornithine. Ornithine is transaminated to glutamate semialdehyde, which is oxidized to glutamate.5. Histidine is converted to formiminoglutamate (FIGLU). The formimino group is transferred to FH4, and the remaining five carbons form glutamate.(b). Amino acids that form succinyl-CoA (see Figure IV)1. Four amino acids are converted to propionyl-CoA, which is carboxylated in a biotin requiring reaction to form methylmalonyl-CoA, which is rearranged to form succinyl-CoA in a reaction that requires vitamin B12 (seen previously in the metabolism of odd-chain number fatty acids).a). Threonine is converted by a dehydratase to NH4+ and a-ketobutyrate, which is oxidatively decarboxylated to propionyl-CoA.In a different set of reactions, threonine is converted to glycine and acetyl-CoA.b). Methionine provides methyl groups for the synthesis of various compounds; its sulfur is incorporated into cysteine; and the remaining carbons form succinyl-CoA.i. Methionine and ATP form S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), which donates a methyl group and forms homocysteine.ii. Homocysteine is reconverted to methionine by accepting a methyl group from the FH4 pool via vitamin B12 .iii. Homocysteine can also react with serine to form cystathionine. The cleavage of cystathionine produces cysteine, NH4+ , and a-ketobutyrate, which is converted to propionyl-CoA.c). Valine and isoleucine, two of the three branched-chain amino acids, form succinyl-CoA (see Figure IV).i. The degradation of all the three branched-chain amino acids begins with a transamination followed by an oxidative decarboxylation catalyzed by the branched-chain a-keto acid dehydrogenase complex (Figure V). This enzyme, like pyruvate dehydrogenase and a-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, requires thiamine pyrophosphate, lipoic acid, CoA, flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), and NAD+.ii. Valine is eventually converted to succinyl-CoA via propionyl-CoA and methylmalonyl-CoA.iii. Isoleucine also forms succinyl-CoA after two of its carbons are released as acetyl-CoA.(c). Amino acids that form fumarate1. Three amino acids (phenylalanine, tyrosine, and aspartate) are converted to fumarate (see Figure II).a). Phenylalanine is converted to tyrosine by phenylalanine hydroxylase in a reaction requiring tetrahydrobiopterin and O2 (Figure VI).b). Tyrosine, obtained from the diet or by hydroxylation of phenylalanine, is converted to homogentisic acid. The aromatic ring is opened and cleaved, forming fumarate and acetoacetate.c). Aspartate is converted to fumarate via reactions of the urea cycle and the purine nucleotide cycle.d). Aspartate reacts with IMP to form AMP and fumarate in the purine nucleotide cycle.(d). Amino acids that form oxaloacetate (see Figure II)1. Aspartate is transaminated to form oxaloacetate.2. Asparagine loses its amide nitrogen as NH4+ , forming aspartate in a reaction catalyzed by asparaginase.c. Amino acids that are converted to acetyl-CoA or acetoacetate (see Figure VI).(1). Four amino acids (lysine, threonine, isoleucine, and tryptophan) can form acetyl-CoA, and phenylalanine and tyrosine form acetoacetate. Leucine is degraded to form both acetyl-CoA and acetoacetate.In maple syrup urine disease, the a-keto acid dehydrogenase involved in metabolism of the branched-chain amino acids (valine, isoleucine, and leucine) is defective. McArdle disease is caused by a defective muscle glycogen phosphorylase, such that the muscle cannot generate glucose from glycogen, leading to exercise intolerance. Glycogen accumulates in the muscle because of this enzyme deficiency (McArdle disease is one of the glycogen storage disease). A defect in the synthesis or processing of collagen will lead to a variety of diseases, of which Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is one (osteogenesis imperfecta is another). Parkinson disease is caused by low levels of dopamine in the nervous system. In the initial stages of Parkinson disease, giving DOPA can reduce the severity of the symptoms because DOPA can be decarboxylated to form dopamine. DOPA can easily enter the brain, whereas dopamine cannot. Tay-Sachs disease results from an inability to degrade GM2, a ganglioside (it is also a sphingolipid). The enzyme missing is b-hexosaminidase.I. Amino acids derived from the intermediates of glycolysis. These amino acids can be synthesized from glucose and can be reconverted to glucose in the liver.II. The degradation of amino acids. A. Amino acids that produce pyruvate or the intermediates of the TCA cycle. These amino acids are considered glucogenic because their carbons can produce glucose in the liver. B. Amino acids that produce acetyl-CoA or ketone bodies. These amino acids are considered ketogenic. CoA, coenzyme A; HMG-CoA, hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA; TCA, tricarboxylic acid.III. Amino acids related through glutamate. These amino acids contain carbons that can be converted to glutamate, which can be converted to glucose in the liver. All of these amino acids except histidine can be synthesized from glucose.IV. Amino acids that can be converted to succinyl-CoA. The amino acids methionine, threonine, isoleucine, and valine, which form succinyl-CoA via methyl malonyl-CoA, are all essential. Because succinyl-CoA can form glucose, these amino acids are glucogenic. The carbons of serine are converted to cysteine and do not form succinyl-CoA by this pathway. A defect in cystathionine synthase causes homocystinuria. A defect in cystathionase causes cystathioninuria. B12-CH3, methyl cobalamin; N5-CH3-FH4, N 5- methyl tetrahydrofolate; PLP, pyridoxal phosphate; SAM, S-adenosylmethionine; TCA, tricarboxylic acid.V. The degradation of the branched-chain amino acids.

In rare cases, febrile seizures that last more than 30 minutes may cause scar tissue in the temporal lobe of the brain. In some of these children, chronic epilepsy develops.

However, the test is expensive & results may take several days to a few weeks to receive. Most leaks will have closed before the results are available, making this a poor test> Protein used in iron transport> Beta 1 - Serum, nasal secretions, tears, saliva> Beta 2 - CSF, perilymph and aqueous humor.> Diagnosis: History - surgeries, accident, unilateral, watery, intermittent, assocaited features like headache, positional variation, associated with anosmia or hyposmia etc.,> Laboratory Tests: Glucose oxidase test: Glucose oxidase strips show color change on detection of glucose (high false negative so abondoned) b2 transferring in the nasal secretions. In CSF Beta 2 transferring is present, and it is absent in normal nasal secretions. (100%sensitivity and 95% specificity. b Trace protection: 100% sensitive and specific Intrathecal radionucleotide test: Most specific Test that help to localise the CSF leak MR cysternography, CT Cysternography (Contraindicated in active meningitis or High ICP) Intrathecal administration of non-ionic contrast with high resolution CT scan. Intrathecal administration of low quantities of Fluorescein can also be used. If the leak is present it can be seen in the nasal cavity with a 490 nm light generated by a special optical filter. Dye injection is done using Barbolage technique in which 1-2 drops of 5% Fluorescein is diluted with the patients own CSF, and then injected partially, then CSF is withdrawn further diluting the dye and then reinjecting the dye.# CSF contains glucose which can be demonstrated by oxidase peroxidase paper strip or biochemical tests. Beta 2 transferrin is specific for CSF.> Analysis of the collected nasal fluid can be both problematic and useful. Analysis of nasal fluid is problematic because simple testing such as observing how the drainage dries on paper (Ring sign) or measuring the sugar content (reflecting the elevated glucose content of CSF) may not be valid.> Presence of the enzyme Beta2-transferrinase is only found in CSF, but requires the collection of several milliliters of fluid to be sent for highly specialized laboratory testing.> To confirm or further identify the route of CSF rhinorrhea, three forms of imaging are available.> Isotope cisternogram is the most sensitive, but least specific form of imaging. Nuclear medicine study consists of placing a low yield radioactive isotope in the subarachnoid space via a lumber puncture or spinal tap. Presence of isotope containing CSF in the nose is confirmed by measuring radioactivity within the nasal cavity or on cotton pledgets placed at probable sites of cerebral spinal fluid drainage from the cranial cavity. Contrast CT cisternography is a more specific, but a less sensitive form of imaging for CSF rhinorrhea. Requires an active leakage of CSF to the nose and involves the placement of an agent opaque to CT imaging within the subarachnoid space.

Intrathecal administration of low quantities of Fluorescein can also be used. If the leak is present it can be seen in the nasal cavity with a 490 nm light generated by a special optical filter. Dye injection is done using Barbolage technique in which 1-2 drops of 5% Fluorescein is diluted with the patients own CSF, and then injected partially, then CSF is withdrawn further diluting the dye and then reinjecting the dye.# CSF contains glucose which can be demonstrated by oxidase peroxidase paper strip or biochemical tests. Beta 2 transferrin is specific for CSF.> Analysis of the collected nasal fluid can be both problematic and useful. Analysis of nasal fluid is problematic because simple testing such as observing how the drainage dries on paper (Ring sign) or measuring the sugar content (reflecting the elevated glucose content of CSF) may not be valid.> Presence of the enzyme Beta2-transferrinase is only found in CSF, but requires the collection of several milliliters of fluid to be sent for highly specialized laboratory testing.> To confirm or further identify the route of CSF rhinorrhea, three forms of imaging are available.> Isotope cisternogram is the most sensitive, but least specific form of imaging. Nuclear medicine study consists of placing a low yield radioactive isotope in the subarachnoid space via a lumber puncture or spinal tap. Presence of isotope containing CSF in the nose is confirmed by measuring radioactivity within the nasal cavity or on cotton pledgets placed at probable sites of cerebral spinal fluid drainage from the cranial cavity. Contrast CT cisternography is a more specific, but a less sensitive form of imaging for CSF rhinorrhea. Requires an active leakage of CSF to the nose and involves the placement of an agent opaque to CT imaging within the subarachnoid space.

Pathophysiology Hypernatraemia occurs due to inadequate concentration of the urine in the face of restricted water intake. This can arise because of failure to generate an adequate medullary concentration gradient in the kidney due to low GFR or loop diuretic therapy, but more commonly is caused by failure of the vasopressin system. This can occur because of pituitary damage (cranial diabetes insipidus ) or because the collecting duct cells are unable to respond to circulating vasopressin concentrations in the face of restricted water intake (nephrogenic diabetes insipidus). Whatever the underlying cause, sustained or severe hypernatraemia generally reflects an impaired thirst mechanism or responsiveness to thirst. Clinical features Patients with hypernatraemia generally have reduced cerebral function, either as a primary problem or as a consequence of the hypernatraemia itself, which results in dehydration of neurons and brain shrinkage. In the presence of an intact thirst mechanism and preserved capacity to obtain and ingest water, hypernatraemia may not progress very far.

V. volume during pregnancy is the presence of grade 2/6 systolic ejection murmur.This physiologic murmur appears at about 10-12 weeks into the pregnancy and disappears in the beginning of the postpartum period.The increase in the intravascular volume fulfills the needs of the developing uteroplacental circulation and protects the mother against the potentially harmful effects of the blood loss that occurs at parturition.The increase in blood volume of pregnancy does not alter the central venous pressure (CVP), which is the same as in the nonpregnant women.Another important hemodynamic change in pregnancy is decreased peripheral vascular resistance (PVR).PVR decreases during pregnancy on the arterial side and the venous side of the circulation. The cause of this change is not well understood, but is most likely a direct effect of placental hormones or vasodilator prostaglandins (prostacyclins) on blood vessels.The decreased peripheral vascular resistance is manifested clinically by a decrease in both mean and diastolic blood pressure. This decrease is clearly observed during second trimester.Because most of the intravascular volume is contained in the capacitance vessels, the decrease in venous resistance represents the adaptation of the vascular tree to the blood volume expansion.

Early Diagnosis: Detection of disturbances while biochemical, functional and morphological changes are still reversible or prior to occurrence of manifest signs and symptoms2. Treatment: Shortens period of communicability, reduces mortality and prevents occurrence of further cases (secondary cases) or any long-term disability- Secondary level of prevention is applied when disease has possibly set in: It attempts to arrest the disease process, seek unrecognized disease and treat it before irreversibility and reverse communicability of infectious diseases- National Health Programs by Govt, of India mostly operate at Secondary level of prevention- Secondary prevention is an imperfect tool in control of transmission of disease: It is more expensive and less effective than primary prevention- It is an important level of prevention for diseases like Tuberculosis, Leprosy and STDs* Tertiary Level of Prevention:- Is applied when disease has advanced beyond early stages: It aims to reduce or limit impairments and disabilities, minimize suffering caused by existing departures from good health- Modes of Intervention:1. Disability Limitation: It 'prevents the transition of disease from impairment to handicap'2. Rehabilitation: Training and retraining of an individual to the highest possible level of functional ability; It can be medical, vocational, social or psychological- Tertiary level of prevention signifies 'intervention in late pathogenesis phase'ALSO REMEMBER* All Vaccines (including Anti-rabies vaccine): Specific Protection mode of intervention, Primary Level of prevention* Screening is predominantly Secondary Level of Prevention with some component of Primary Prevention also", "cop": 2, "opa": "High risk strategy", "opb": "Primary prevention", "opc": "Secondary prevention", "opd": "Tertiary prevention", "subject_name": "Social & Preventive Medicine", "topic_name": "Miscellaneous", "id": "69e30356-67c8-4718-b222-8799b840171b", "choice_type": "single"}, "correct": true, "pred": 1, "probs": [0.14690043032169342, 0.7008227705955505, 0.10747465491294861, 0.04480209946632385], "golden_prob": 0.7008227705955505, "pred_prob": 0.7008227705955505, "output": 1}

However, only one retrovirus, the human T cell lympho- tropic virus-1 (HTLV-1), has been demonstrated to cause cancer in humans. HTLV-1 is associated with a form of T cell leukemia/lymphoma that is endemic in ceain pas of Japan and the Caribbean basin but is found sporadically elsewhere, including the United States. Similar to the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), HTLV-1 has tropism for CD4+ T cells, and this subset of T cells is the major target for neoplastic transformation. Human infec- tion requires transmission of infected T cells through sexual intercourse, blood products, or breastfeeding. Leukemia develops only in about 3% to 5% of infected persons after a long latent period of 20 to 50 years. There is little doubt that HTLV-1 infection of T lympho- cytes is necessary for leukemogenesis, but the molecular mechanisms of transformation are not clear. The HTLV-1 genome does not contain a viral oncogene, and in contrast with ceain animal retroviruses, no consistent integration site next to a cellular oncogene has been discovered. Indeed, the long latency period between initial infection and devel- opment of disease suggests a multistep process, during which many oncogenic mutations are accumulated. The genome of HTLV-1 contains, in addition to the usual retroviral genes, a unique region called pX. This region contains several genes, including one called TAX. The TAX protein has been shown to be necessary and sufficient for cellular transformation. By interacting with several transcription factors, such as NF-kB, the TAX protein can transactivate the expression of genes that encode cytokines, cytokine receptors, and costimulatory molecules. This inappropriate gene expression leads to autocrine signaling loops and increased activation of promitogenic signaling cascades. Fuhermore, TAX can drive progression through the cell cycle by directly binding to and activating cyclins. In addition, TAX can repress the function of several tumor suppressor genes that control the cell cycle, including CDKN2A/p16 and TP53. From these and other observa- tions, the following scenario is emerging (Fig. 5-31): The TAX gene turns on several cytokine genes and their recep- tors (e.g., the interleukins IL-2 and IL-2R and IL-15 and IL-15R), setting up an autocrine system that drives T cell proliferation. Of these cytokines, IL-15 seems to be more impoant, but much remains to be defined. Additionally, a parallel paracrine pathway is activated by increased pro- duction of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, which stimulates neighboring macrophages to produce other T cell mitogens. Initially, the T cell prolifera- tion is polyclonal, because the virus infects many cells, but because of TAX-based inactivation of tumor suppressor genes such as TP53, the proliferating T cells are at increased risk for secondary transforming events (mutations), which lead ultimately to the outgrowth of a monoclonal neoplas- tic T cell population.", "raw": {"question": "Tropical spastic paraparesis is caused by", "exp": "Oncogenic RNA Viruses The study of oncogenic retroviruses in animals has pro- vided spectacular insights into the genetic basis of cancer.

There is a male preponderance, a peak incidence in the second and third decades, and rare familial clustering.# The two most common presentations of IgA nephropathy are recurrent episodes of macroscopic hematuria during or immediately following an upper respiratory infection in children (Henoch-Schonlein purpura) or asymptomatic microscopic hematuria most often seen in adults.# Rx: - ACE inhibitors in patients with proteinuria or declining renal function.- Tonsillectomy, steroid therapy, and fish oil have all been suggested to benefit some patients.- When presenting as RPGN, patients need steroids, cytotoxic agents, and plasmapheresis.RENAL INVOLVEMENT in Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS) and Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP)# Microscopic hematuria (78%) and subnephrotic proteinuria (75%) are the most consistent findings.# The characteristic lesion in HUS/TTP is thrombotic microangiopathy.# Microthrombi are demonstrated in renal arterioles and capillaries.# In TTP, microthrombi are composed mainly of platelet aggregates and thin layer of fibrin and stain strongly for vWF, implicated in its pathogenesis. In contrast, microthrombi in HUS contain predominantly fibrin.# Subendothelial hyaline deposits and endothelial cell swelling also contribute to vascular occlusion. Glomerular lesions are ischemic. The glomerular capillary walls are wrinkled, the glomerular tuft may be atrophied, and the Bowman capsule is thickened. Acute cortical or tubular necrosis may occur.# Immunofluorescence studies invariably demonstrate fibrinogen along the glomerular capillary walls and in arterial thrombi. Granular deposits of C3 and IgM may be observed in vessel walls and glomeruli.# Electron-microscopic studies demonstrate swelling of the glomerular endothelial cells and detachment from the glomerular basement membrane.", "cop": 1, "opa": "Henoch Schoenlein Purpura", "opb": "Malaria", "opc": "Good Pasture's Syndrome", "opd": "Wegener's Granulomatosis", "subject_name": "Pathology", "topic_name": "Kidney", "id": "d7b80d2f-b3fb-451f-a207-1f15b802f2eb", "choice_type": "single"}, "correct": true, "pred": 0, "probs": [0.5817685127258301, 0.1565808802843094, 0.1666794717311859, 0.09497109800577164], "golden_prob": 0.5817685127258301, "pred_prob": 0.5817685127258301, "output": 0}

All phosphorus poisoning are caused by white (yellow) phosphorus (Red phosphorus is nontoxic).Phosphorus poisoningo Phosphorus is a protoplasmic poison affecting cellular oxidation and causing anoxic necorbiosis, classically affecting liver. It increases fat deposition and inhibits glycogen deposition in liver. It is used in fire works (Diwali poisoning) and as rat poison. Lethal dose is 60-120 mg.o Phosphorus occurs in two forms:-1) White/yellow phosphorus: It is white, and becomes yellow on exposure to air. It is translucent, waxy, luminous and crystalline cylinders. It has garlic like odor. It is insoluble in water and luminous in dark. Its fumes show phosphorescence.2) Red phosphorus : It is reddish brown, inert, odourless and tasteless. It is nontoxic (thus poisoning occurs only due to white phosphorus). It is put on the sides (striking surface) of match box (along with powdered galss).Acute poisoningo It has following stages:i) 1st Stage (GI irritation): There is nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and garlic odor. This stage lasts for 8 hours to 3 days.ii) 2nd Stage (Asymptomatic): This stage lasts for 3 days.iii) 3rd Stage: There is liver and kidney damage due to absorbed phosphorus. Initially liver is enlarged due to acute fatty infiltration. Later liver shruks due to necrosis, i.e. acute yellow atrophy.Chronic poisoningo Toothache is the first symptom which is associated with loosening of teeth, necrosis of gums and osteomyelitis of jaw. Therefore chronic phosphorus poisoning is also know as phossy jaw (or glass jaw).Postmortem appearanceo There is garlic odor.

It has garlic like odor. It is insoluble in water and luminous in dark. Its fumes show phosphorescence.2) Red phosphorus : It is reddish brown, inert, odourless and tasteless. It is nontoxic (thus poisoning occurs only due to white phosphorus). It is put on the sides (striking surface) of match box (along with powdered galss).Acute poisoningo It has following stages:i) 1st Stage (GI irritation): There is nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and garlic odor. This stage lasts for 8 hours to 3 days.ii) 2nd Stage (Asymptomatic): This stage lasts for 3 days.iii) 3rd Stage: There is liver and kidney damage due to absorbed phosphorus. Initially liver is enlarged due to acute fatty infiltration. Later liver shruks due to necrosis, i.e. acute yellow atrophy.Chronic poisoningo Toothache is the first symptom which is associated with loosening of teeth, necrosis of gums and osteomyelitis of jaw. Therefore chronic phosphorus poisoning is also know as phossy jaw (or glass jaw).Postmortem appearanceo There is garlic odor. Viscera and stool glow in dark (due to luminosity).o To preserve luminosity, viscera are preserved in saturated saline solution.

C. Determining the appropriate placement of endotracheal tube. (Ref. Clinical Anesthesia by Paul 5th/pg. 670-671)Clinical Anesthesia by Paul 5th Edition/pg. 671..........\"Capnography is an essential element in determining the appropriate placement of endotracheal tubes. The presence of a stable ETCO2 for three successive breaths indicates that the tube is not in the esophagus. A continuous, stable CO2 waveform ensures the presence of alveolar ventilation but does not necessarily indicate that the endotracheal tube is properly positioned in the trachea. For example, the tip of the tube could be located in a main-stem bronchus. Capnography is also a monitor of potential changes in perfusion or dead space, is a very sensitive indicator of anesthetic circuit disconnects and gas circuit leaks, and is a method to detect the quality of CO2 absorption\".Endotracheal intubation or laryngeal mask airway insertion requires qualitative identification of carbon dioxide in the expired gas. During general anesthesia, capnography and end-tidal carbon dioxide analysis are encouraged. Capnometry is the measurement and numeric representation of the C02 concentration during inspiration and expiration. A capnogram is a continuous concentration-time display of the C02 concentration sampled at a patient's airway during ventilation.Capnography# is the continuous monitoring of a patient's capnogram.# The capnogram is divided into four distinct phases (Fi. The first phase (A-B) represents the initial stage of expiration. Gas sampled during this phase occupies the anatomic dead space and is normally devoid of CO2. At point B, CO2- containing gas presents itself at the sampling site, and a sharp upstroke (B-C) is seen in the capnogram. The slope of this upstroke is determined by the evenness of ventilation and alveolar emptying. Phase C-D represents the alveolar or expiratory plateau. At this phase of the capnogram, alveolar gas is being sampled. Normally, this part of the waveform is almost horizontal. Point D is the highest CO2 value and is called the end-tidal CO2 (ETCO2). ETCO2 is the best reflection of the alveolar CO2 (PACO2). As the patient begins to inspire, fresh gas is entrained and there is a steep downstroke (D-E) back to baseline. Unless rebreathing of CO2 occurs, the baseline approaches zero.# The utility of capnography depends on an understanding of the relationship between arterial CO2 (PaCO2), alveolar CO2 (PACO2), and ETCO2. If the PaCO2-PACO2 gradient is constant and small, capnography provides a noninvasive, continuous, real-time reflection of ventilation. During general anesthesia, the ETC02-PaC02 gradient typically is 5 to 10 mm Hg.# Maldistribution is a common cause of an increased PaCO2-PACO2 gradient. Other patient factors that may influence the accuracy of ETCO2 monitoring by widening the PaCO2-ETCO2 gradient include shallow tidal breaths, prolongation of the expiratory phase of ventilation, or uneven alveolar emptying.# Increases in ETCO2 can be expected when CO2 production exceeds ventilation, such as in hyperthermia or when an exogenous source of CO2 is present# A sudden drop in ETCO2 to near zero followed by the absence of a CO2 waveform is a potentially life-threatening problem that could indicate malposition of an endotracheal tube into the pharynx or esophagus, sudden severe hypotension, pulmonary embolism, a cardiac arrest, or an artifact resulting from disruption of sampling lines. During life-saving cardiopulmonary resuscitation, the generation of adequate perfusion can be assessed by the restoration of the CO2 waveform.# Whereas abrupt decreases in the ETCO2 are often associated with an altered cardiopulmonary status (e.g., embolism or hypoperfusion), gradual reductions in ETCO2 more often reflect decreases in PaCO2 that occur after increases in minute ventilation where ventilation overmatches CO2 production.# Several methods for the quantification of CO2 have been applied to patient monitoring systems.

Detection of antibody: By indirect haemagglutination test, fluorescent antibody test, counter current immunoelectrophoresis, latex agglutination test, ELISA, western blot test. MRI, Ultrasonography and CT scanning readily demonstrate cysts. The most pathognomonic finding, if demonstrable, is the presence of daughter cysts within the larger cyst.

Antigen in serum can be detected by ELISA, counter current immunoelectrophoresis, co-agglutination test, and latex agglutination test. Detection of antibody: By indirect haemagglutination test, fluorescent antibody test, counter current immunoelectrophoresis, latex agglutination test, ELISA, western blot test. MRI, Ultrasonography and CT scanning readily demonstrate cysts. The most pathognomonic finding, if demonstrable, is the presence of daughter cysts within the larger cyst. Diagnostic aspiration of cystic fluid is not usually recommended because of the risk of fluid leakage resulting in either dissemination of infection or anaphylactic reactions.

{"id": 135424, "question": "Laughing gas is", "choices": ["Nitrous oxide", "Halothane", "Chloroform", "Diethylether"], "answer": 0, "explanation": "Humphry Davy coined the name \"laughing gas\" for nitrous oxide. Nitrous oxide, commonly known as laughing gas or nitrous, is a chemical compound, an oxide of nitrogen with the formula N2O. At room temperature, it is a colourless, non-flammable gas, with a slight metallic scent and taste. At elevated temperatures, nitrous oxide is a powerful oxidiser similar to molecular oxygen. It is soluble in water. Nitrous oxide is a weak general anaesthetic, and so is generally not used alone in general anaesthesia, but used as a carrier gas (mixed with oxygen) for more powerful general anaesthetic drugs such as sevoflurane or desflurane. It has a minimum alveolar concentration of 105% and a blood/gas paition coefficient of 0.46. The use of nitrous oxide in anaesthesia, however, can increase the risk of postoperative nausea and vomiting. Recreational inhalation of nitrous oxide, with the purpose of causing euphoria and/or slight hallucinations, began as a phenomenon for the British upper class in 1799, known as \"laughing gas paies\". In rats, N2O stimulates the mesolimbic reward pathway by inducing dopamine release and activating dopaminergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area and nucleus accumbens, presumably through antagonistic of NMDA receptors localised in the system. This action has been implicated in its euphoric effects and, notably, appears to augment its analgesic propeies as well. It is remarkable, however, that in mice, N2O blocks amphetamine-induced carrier-mediated dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens and behavioural sensitisation, abolishes the conditioned place preference (CPP) of cocaine and morphine, and does not produce reinforcing (or aversive) effects of its own. Effects of CPP of N2O in rats are mixed, consisting of reinforcement, aversion and no change. In contrast, it is a positive reinforcer in squirrel monkeys, and is well known as a drug of abuse in humans. These discrepancies in response to N2O may reflect species variation or methodological differences. In human clinical studies, N2O was found to produce mixed responses, similarly to rats, reflecting high subjective individual variability.", "raw": {"question": "Laughing gas is", "exp": "Humphry Davy coined the name \"laughing gas\" for nitrous oxide.

Endometrial carcinoma is seen in individuals on long-term estrogen therapy, but was not seen in the progeny of DES-treated women. Ovarian carcinoma is increased in nulliparous women, and in those with a family history of the disorder. Ref: Cunningham F.G., Leveno K.J., Bloom S.L., Hauth J.C., Rouse D.J., Spong C.Y. (2010).

In 1939, Mondor described the condition as \"string phlebitis ,\" a thrombosed vein presenting as a tender, cord-like structure. Frequently involved veins include the lateral thoracic vein, the thoracoepigastric vein, and, less commonly, the superficial epigastric vein. Typically, a woman presents with acute pain in the lateral aspect of the breast or the anterior chest wall. A tender, firm cord is found to follow the distribution of one of the major superficial veins. Rarely, the presentation is bilateral, and most women have no evidence of thrombophlebitis in other anatomic sites. This benign, self-limited disorder is not indicative of a cancer. When the diagnosis is uncertain, or when a mass is present near the tender cord, biopsy is indicated.

In 1939, Mondor described the condition as \"string phlebitis ,\" a thrombosed vein presenting as a tender, cord-like structure. Frequently involved veins include the lateral thoracic vein, the thoracoepigastric vein, and, less commonly, the superficial epigastric vein. Typically, a woman presents with acute pain in the lateral aspect of the breast or the anterior chest wall. A tender, firm cord is found to follow the distribution of one of the major superficial veins. Rarely, the presentation is bilateral, and most women have no evidence of thrombophlebitis in other anatomic sites. This benign, self-limited disorder is not indicative of a cancer. When the diagnosis is uncertain, or when a mass is present near the tender cord, biopsy is indicated. Therapy for Mondor's disease includes the liberal use of anti-inflammatory medications and application of warm compresses along the symptomatic vein. Restriction of motion of the ipsilateral extremity and shoulder as well as brassiere support of the breast are important. The process usually resolves within 4 to 6 weeks.

C: Lagophthalmos Lagophthalmos is a condition in which there is incomplete closure of the palpebral apeure when an attempt is made to shut the eyes Lagophthalmos It is defined as the inability to close the eyelids completely. Blinking covers the eye with a thin layer of tear fluid, thereby promoting a moist environment necessary for the cells of the exterior pa of the eye. The tears also flush out foreign bodies and wash them away. This is crucial to maintain lubrication and proper eye health. If this process is impaired, as in lagophthalmos, the eye can suffer abrasions and infections. Lagopthalmos leads to corneal drying and ulceration Pathophysiology Lagophthalmos can arise from a malfunction of the Facial nerve. Lagopthalmos can also occur in comatose patients having a decrease in orbicularis tone, in patients having palsy of the facial nerve (7th cranial nerve), and in people with severe skin disorders such as ichthyosis. Today, lagophthalmos may arise after an overenthusiastic upper blepharoplasty. Blepharoplasty is an operation performed to remove excessive skin overlying the upper eyelid (suprapalpebral hooding) that often occurs with aging.

{"id": 67815, "question": "Which of the following is most common haemoglobinopathy", "choices": ["Thalassemia", "Sickle cell anemia", "Haemoglobin C", "Spherocytosis"], "answer": 1, "explanation": "On deoxygenation, HbS molecules form long polymers by means of intermolecular contacts that involve the abnormal valine residue at position 6. These polymers disto the red cell, which assumes an elongated crescentic, or sickle, shape (Fig. 11-3). The sickling of red cells initially is reversible upon reoxygenation. However, the distoion of the membrane that is produced by each sickling episode leads to an influx of calcium, which causes the loss of potassium and water and also damages the membrane skeleton. Over time, this cumu- lative damage creates irreversibly sickled cells, which are rapidly hemolyzed. Many variables influence the sickling of red cells in vivo. The three most impoant factors are * The presence of hemoglobins other than HbS. In heterozygotes approximately 40% of Hb is HbS and the remainder is HbA, which interacts only weakly with deox- ygenated HbS. Because the presence of HbA greatly retards the polymerization of HbS, the red cells of het- erozygotes have little tendency to sickle in vivo. Such persons are said to have sickle cell trait. HbC, another mutant b-globin, has a lysine residue instead of the normal glutamic acid residue at position 6. About 2.3% of Ameri- can blacks are heterozygous carriers of HbC; as a result, about 1 in 1250 newborns are compound heterozygotes for HbC and HbS. Because HbC has a greater tendency to aggregate with HbS than does HbA, HbS/HbC com- pound heterozygotes have a symptomatic sickling disorder called HbSC disease. HbF interacts weakly with HbS, so newborns with sickle cell anemia do not manifest the disease until HbF falls to adult levels, generally around the age of 5 to 6 months. * The intracellular concentration of HbS. The polyA merization of deoxygenated HbS is strongly concentration- dependent. Thus, red cell dehydration, which increases the Hb concentration, facilitates sickling. Conversely, the coexistence of a-thalassemia (described later), which decreases the Hb concentration, reduces sickling. The relatively low concentration of HbS also contributes to the absence of sickling in heterozygotes with sickle cell trait. * The transit time for red cells through the micro- vasculature. The normal transit times of red cells through capillaries are too sho for significant polymeriza- tion of deoxygenated HbS to occur. Hence, sickling in microvascular beds is confined to areas of the body in which blood flow is sluggish. This is the normal situation in the spleen and the bone marrow, two tissues promi- nently affected by sickle cell disease. Sickling also can be triggered in other microvascular beds by acquired factors that retard the passage of red cells. As described previ- ously, inflammation slows the flow of blood by increasing the adhesion of leukocytes and red cells to endothelium and by inducing the exudation of fluid through leaky vessels. In addition, sickle red cells have a greater tendency than normal red cells to adhere to endothelial cells, appar- ently because repeated bouts of sickling causes mem- brane damage that make them sticky. These factors conspire to prolong the transit times of sickle red cells, increasing the probability of clinically significant sickling. Two major consequences arise from the sickling of red cells (Fig. 11-4). First, the red cell membrane damage and dehydration caused by repeated episodes of sickling produce a chronic hemolytic anemia. The mean life span of red cells in sickle cell anemia is only 20 days (one sixth of normal). Second, red cell sickling produces widespread microvascular obstructions, which result in ischemic tissue damage and pain crises. Vaso-occlusion does not cor- relate with the number of irreversibly sickled cells and there- fore appears to result from factors such as infection, inflammation, dehydration, and acidosis that enhance the sickling of reversibly sickled cells.

All pregnant women should have HIV testing at an early stage in pregnancy. The CD4 count falls by about 25% during pregnancy due to haemodilution.

In the pre-A era, the rate of mother-to-child transmission was 15-40%, with rates being influenced by several factors .A has dramatically reduced the risk of mother-to-child transmission of HIV to less than 1%. All pregnant women should sta A at the beginning of the second trimester, unless they have advanced disease, when A should be staed in the first trimester. Caesarean section is associated with a lower risk of mother- to-child transmission than vaginal delivery, but the mode of delivery does not affect transmission risk if the viral load is suppressed on A. HIV is also transmitted by breastfeeding. In high-income countries, exclusive formula feeding is generally recommended. In resource-poor settings, however, formula feeding is associated with a risk of infant morbidity and moality, which may negate the benefit of not transmitting HIV to the infant. There is minimal risk of transmitting HIV by breastfeeding in women with a suppressed viral load on A.

The tremor often spreads to the other side of the body as the disease progresses, but usually remains most apparent on the initially affected side.", "cop": 1, "opa": "Tremors", "opb": "Rigidity", "opc": "Bradykinesia", "opd": "Chorea", "subject_name": "Medicine", "topic_name": "Parkinsonism", "id": "298278d6-494a-4ba3-a54d-160de13e624d", "choice_type": "single"}, "correct": true, "pred": 0, "probs": [0.5439430475234985, 0.08879626542329788, 0.30992943048477173, 0.05733117461204529], "golden_prob": 0.5439430475234985, "pred_prob": 0.5439430475234985, "output": 0}
