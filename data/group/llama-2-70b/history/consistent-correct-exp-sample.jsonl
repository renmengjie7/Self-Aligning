This was a reflection of their growing influence and control over Chinese affairs during the late Qing Dynasty.\n\nThe presence of foreign embassies in Beijing meant that the imperialist countries would have a physical presence and diplomatic representation within Chinese territory.

It represents the government of the sending state in the host country. The establishment of an embassy typically signifies an official diplomatic relationship between the two countries.\n\nIn the context of the Xinju Treaty, which was signed in 1901 between China and several imperialist countries (including Britain, Germany, Russia, Japan, and France), the treaty allowed these countries to establish embassies in Beijing. This was a reflection of their growing influence and control over Chinese affairs during the late Qing Dynasty.\n\nThe presence of foreign embassies in Beijing meant that the imperialist countries would have a physical presence and diplomatic representation within Chinese territory.

While both groups sought to modernize and strengthen their respective societies, their strategies and objectives differed.\n\nReformists aimed to reform the political system in order to address the internal issues and challenges faced by their societies. They sought to introduce political and administrative reforms that would modernize and improve the function of the government. This could involve changes in the structure, powers, or processes of the political system, such as the introduction of a constitution, the establishment of representative assemblies, or the implementation of more efficient bureaucratic structures.\n\nOn the other hand, Westernizers focused on adopting Western political, social, and economic models as a means of modernization. Their aim was to emulate and adopt the political systems and institutions of Western countries, seeing them as more advanced and capable of bringing progress and development.

Confucius believed that education is the foundation for personal growth and societal harmony. This emphasis on learning has led to the establishment of a rigorous and highly revered education system in East Asia, which has been instrumental in the region's intellectual and cultural development.\n\nThirdly, Confucianism promotes social harmony and the maintenance of stable relationships within society. Confucius emphasized the Five Relationships, which outline the proper behavior and obligations between individuals in different social roles. This emphasis on harmonious interactions has had a lasting impact on social norms and expectations in East Asian cultures.\n\nLastly, Confucianism has had a profound influence on political systems. The doctrine of the \"Mandate of Heaven\" in Confucianism suggests that rulers have a moral responsibility to govern justly and for the benefit of the people. This concept has shaped the ideals and expectations of political leaders in East Asia throughout history.\n\nOverall, the Confucian school of thought's emphasis on moral values, education, social harmony, and political governance has had a transformative influence on the ideology and culture of later generations, making it the most influential school of thought in history."}, "correct": true, "pred": 0, "probs": [0.8684081435203552, 0.019185636192560196, 0.03163176402449608, 0.08077454566955566], "golden_prob": 0.8684081435203552, "pred_prob": 0.8684081435203552, "output": 0}

However, this system was plagued by corruption, inefficiency, and outdated practices.\n\nFirstly, the feudal system hindered technological advancements and modernization. While Britain had rapidly developed industrial technology and military advancements, China's feudal system stifled innovation and hindered the development of military technology and equipment. As a result, China's military was ill-prepared to counter the modern military tactics and weaponry utilized by the British during the Opium War.\n\nSecondly, the feudal system led to a weak and ineffective government, which was unable to effectively respond to the challenges posed by foreign powers. The system was riddled with corruption, nepotism, and a lack of meritocracy, which undermined the efficiency and effectiveness of the bureaucracy. This weakened the government's ability to make strategic decisions and effectively mobilize resources for war.\n\nFurthermore, the feudal system also resulted in a fragmented and divided society. Feudal lords and regional powers held significant autonomy, often prioritizing their own interests over the central government's agenda. This lack of unity and coordination further weakened China's ability to resist foreign aggression.\n\nIn the context of the Opium War, the British, with their strong military and advanced technology, were able to exploit the weaknesses of China's feudal system. They took advantage of the corruption and inefficiency within the Chinese government, using methods such as bribery to gain control and influence. The British military's superiority allowed them to establish dominance and force the Chinese Empire to accept unfavorable treaties, ceding territories and opening up the country to increased foreign influence and control.\n\nTherefore, the fundamental reason for China's failure in the Opium War can be attributed to the weaknesses inherent in the country's feudal system, including its hindrance to technological advancements, weak governance, fragmented society, and susceptibility to external manipulation.", "raw": {"question": "Before the Opium War, the \"Chinese Empire\" was one of the major economic powers in the world at that time, but it failed in the Opium War, the fundamental reason is _____", "labels": ["Political Economy", "Theoretical Economics", "History", "Philosophy", "Chinese Philosophy", "Economics", "Philosophy (Level 1 subject)"], "answer": "A rotten feudal system", "options": "A rotten feudal system\nChina's military technology and equipment are backward\nThe war generals were afraid of death\nBritain has a strong military"}, "gen_exp": {"input": "The following is a multi choice question about history.\n\nBefore the Opium War, the \"Chinese Empire\" was one of the major economic powers in the world at that time, but it failed in the Opium War, the fundamental reason is _____\nA.

Please explain why.\n    ", "output": "The answer to the question is \"A rotten feudal system\" because it was a major factor that contributed to China's failure in the Opium War.\n\nThe Chinese Empire during this period was characterized by a feudal system, which was a hierarchical social structure with a strong emphasis on loyalty and obedience to the emperor. However, this system was plagued by corruption, inefficiency, and outdated practices.\n\nFirstly, the feudal system hindered technological advancements and modernization. While Britain had rapidly developed industrial technology and military advancements, China's feudal system stifled innovation and hindered the development of military technology and equipment. As a result, China's military was ill-prepared to counter the modern military tactics and weaponry utilized by the British during the Opium War.\n\nSecondly, the feudal system led to a weak and ineffective government, which was unable to effectively respond to the challenges posed by foreign powers. The system was riddled with corruption, nepotism, and a lack of meritocracy, which undermined the efficiency and effectiveness of the bureaucracy. This weakened the government's ability to make strategic decisions and effectively mobilize resources for war.\n\nFurthermore, the feudal system also resulted in a fragmented and divided society. Feudal lords and regional powers held significant autonomy, often prioritizing their own interests over the central government's agenda. This lack of unity and coordination further weakened China's ability to resist foreign aggression.\n\nIn the context of the Opium War, the British, with their strong military and advanced technology, were able to exploit the weaknesses of China's feudal system. They took advantage of the corruption and inefficiency within the Chinese government, using methods such as bribery to gain control and influence. The British military's superiority allowed them to establish dominance and force the Chinese Empire to accept unfavorable treaties, ceding territories and opening up the country to increased foreign influence and control.\n\nTherefore, the fundamental reason for China's failure in the Opium War can be attributed to the weaknesses inherent in the country's feudal system, including its hindrance to technological advancements, weak governance, fragmented society, and susceptibility to external manipulation."}, "correct": true, "pred": 0, "probs": [0.817915141582489, 0.10398624837398529, 0.010960068553686142, 0.06713856011629105], "golden_prob": 0.817915141582489, "pred_prob": 0.817915141582489, "output": 0}

During this time, Germany was divided into multiple separate feudal states, each with their own rulers, laws, and systems of governance. This fragmentation prevented the establishment of a unified German state or government, making it difficult to implement national policies or reforms.\n\nMoreover, the feudal system limited social mobility and economic growth. Feudalism was characterized by a hierarchical structure where power and land were concentrated in the hands of a few nobles or aristocrats. This system stifled entrepreneurship and hindered the development of a modern industrialized economy. The lack of a unified market and standardized legal system also hampered economic progress and trade within Germany.\n\nAdditionally, the feudal separation in Germany fostered regionalism and regional identities, leading to ethnic differences and disputes.

This fragmentation prevented the establishment of a unified German state or government, making it difficult to implement national policies or reforms.\n\nMoreover, the feudal system limited social mobility and economic growth. Feudalism was characterized by a hierarchical structure where power and land were concentrated in the hands of a few nobles or aristocrats. This system stifled entrepreneurship and hindered the development of a modern industrialized economy. The lack of a unified market and standardized legal system also hampered economic progress and trade within Germany.\n\nAdditionally, the feudal separation in Germany fostered regionalism and regional identities, leading to ethnic differences and disputes.

This method greatly increased the speed and efficiency of book production, making it possible to print multiple copies of a book quickly.\n\nThe invention of movable type printing in ancient China made books more accessible and affordable to the general public. It led to an exponential increase in the number of books being printed, putting China far ahead of the rest of the world in terms of book production until the middle of the 18th century.

By merging Christianity with Chinese religious beliefs, Hong was able to create a unique religious and social movement that resonated with the Chinese population and had a significant impact on modern Chinese history."}, "correct": true, "pred": 2, "probs": [0.14625070989131927, 0.12906581163406372, 0.5784327983856201, 0.14625070989131927], "golden_prob": 0.5784327983856201, "pred_prob": 0.5784327983856201, "output": 2}

Confucianism also valued education and placed a strong emphasis on the role of the ruler in setting a virtuous example for the people. \n\nConfucianism was widely embraced by the ruling class and became the official state ideology during the Han Dynasty, lasting for hundreds of years. Its influence can be seen in many aspects of Chinese culture, including its emphasis on filial piety, respect for elders, and the importance of maintaining social harmony.

Under the old system, the noble families held most of the power and land, while the common people were subjected to harsh feudal obligations and had limited social mobility. Shang Yang's reforms aimed to break this system of exploitation and inequality by redistributing land and power to increase the strength and unity of the state.\n\nShang Yang also introduced a strict system of laws and regulations, known as the \"Legalist\" approach, which aimed to ensure social order and economic development.

The Qing Dynasty, which ruled China at the time, was dealing with internal corruption, peasant grievances, and a weak central government. These issues resulted in social unrest and created a fertile ground for rebellion.\n\nThe class contradictions within Chinese society were also worsening during this period. The majority of the population, particularly the lower social classes such as peasants and laborers, faced severe poverty and exploitation. At the same time, a small elite class composed of landlords and government officials enjoyed significant privileges and wealth. This stark inequality and class divide fueled resentment and dissatisfaction among the lower classes.\n\nHong Xiuquan, the leader of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom Movement, capitalized on these grievances and harnessed the discontent of the lower classes.

The Qing Dynasty, which ruled China at the time, was dealing with internal corruption, peasant grievances, and a weak central government. These issues resulted in social unrest and created a fertile ground for rebellion.\n\nThe class contradictions within Chinese society were also worsening during this period. The majority of the population, particularly the lower social classes such as peasants and laborers, faced severe poverty and exploitation. At the same time, a small elite class composed of landlords and government officials enjoyed significant privileges and wealth. This stark inequality and class divide fueled resentment and dissatisfaction among the lower classes.\n\nHong Xiuquan, the leader of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom Movement, capitalized on these grievances and harnessed the discontent of the lower classes. He preached a radical form of Christianity mixed with Chinese millenarianism, promising a new equal and just society. His message resonated with the impoverished and marginalized peasants, who saw the movement as a way to alleviate their suffering and challenge the oppressive ruling elite.\n\nThus, it was the intensification of class contradictions, along with other socio-political issues, that provided the foundation for the rise of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom Movement.

The Hemudu original inhabitants played a crucial role in the early cultivation of rice in China, contributing to the development and spread of rice agriculture.\n\nOn the other hand, the other options provided in the question were not directly associated with the cultivation of rice. The Yuanmou man is known for being one of the earliest hominids in China but there is no evidence linking them to rice cultivation. Peking man, also known as Homo erectus, is another early hominid species, but their significance lies more in human evolution rather than agriculture. Banpo original inhabitants were an ancient Neolithic culture in China, known for their pottery and early settlements, but there is no specific evidence of their contribution to rice cultivation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is \"Hemudu original inhabitants\" as they played a significant role in the cultivation of rice in the ancient Yancheng region."}, "correct": true, "pred": 2, "probs": [0.1536511778831482, 0.04135465249419212, 0.6077021956443787, 0.1972920149564743], "golden_prob": 0.6077021956443787, "pred_prob": 0.6077021956443787, "output": 2}

As societies progressed, they began to find more efficient ways to produce goods and services, which led to an increase in productivity. This increase in productivity ultimately brought about significant changes in the structure and organization of primitive society.\n\nWith the development of social productive forces, the primitive society started to witness the emergence of surplus production. Surplus production occurs when a society produces more than what is necessary for basic survival. This surplus allowed for the specialization of labor, where individuals could focus on specific tasks or trades, rather than being solely reliant on subsistence farming or hunting.\n\nAs specialization of labor increased, so did the division of labor, which created the need for a more organized social structure. The primitive society transitioned from a simple collective existence to a more complex society with distinct classes. This led to the generation of class divisions, as some individuals gained control over the surplus production and resources, while others became dependent on their labor.\n\nThe development of social productive forces also brought about the emergence of private property.

Division of Europe: After World War II, Europe was divided into Western Europe, which was under the influence of the United States and its NATO allies, and Eastern Europe, which fell under the control of the Soviet Union and its satellite states. These divisions resulted in the formation of the Iron Curtain, creating a clear divide between the two ideological blocs.\n\n2. Two competing ideologies: The Cold War pitted the United States and its democratic allies against the Soviet Union and its communist allies. Europe became the battleground for the clash of these two ideologies. The United States implemented policies such as the Marshall Plan to counter the spread of communism, while the Soviet Union supported communist movements in various European countries.\n\n3. Strategic importance: Europe held significant strategic importance during the Cold War. It was viewed as a potential area of military conflict, and both sides deployed military forces and built up their nuclear arsenals in Europe. The division of Germany, with West Germany aligning with the West and East Germany with the Soviets, further heightened tensions.\n\n4. Proxy conflicts: While the Cold War was a global conflict, Europe saw several proxy wars and conflicts between the two superpowers. The most notable instance was the Korean War, where the United States and its allies fought against communist forces supported by the Soviet Union and China. Europe also witnessed conflicts in Germany, Hungary, and Czechoslovakia, among others.\n\nDue to these factors, Europe became the primary arena for Cold War policy, with both sides engaging in political, military, and ideological struggles in the region."}, "correct": true, "pred": 0, "probs": [0.6727356910705566, 0.21840530633926392, 0.037953149527311325, 0.07090581953525543], "golden_prob": 0.6727356910705566, "pred_prob": 0.6727356910705566, "output": 0}

Kennedy, discovered the presence of these missiles and perceived them as a direct threat to its national security. Kennedy demanded their removal and imposed a naval blockade on Cuba to prevent further weapons shipments.\n\nThe crisis escalated tensions between the two countries and brought them to the brink of nuclear war. The world held its breath as both sides engaged in intense diplomatic negotiations, with the threat of mutual destruction hanging in the balance. Ultimately, the crisis was resolved through a secret agreement between Kennedy and Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev, in which the Soviet Union agreed to remove the missiles in exchange for a US commitment not to invade Cuba.\n\nThe Cuban missile crisis is considered one of the most dangerous moments of the Cold War and a significant event in the rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union. It highlighted the potential of nuclear conflict and the importance of diplomacy and negotiation in avoiding catastrophic outcomes."}, "correct": true, "pred": 2, "probs": [0.06199313700199127, 0.027509288862347603, 0.8557888269424438, 0.05470874905586243], "golden_prob": 0.8557888269424438, "pred_prob": 0.8557888269424438, "output": 2}

These texts were selected as the core curriculum for learning Confucianism, which was the dominant ideology and educational philosophy of that time.\n\nThe Four Books consist of the Analects of Confucius, The Great Learning, The Doctrine of the Mean, and Mencius. These texts epitomize Confucian teachings, emphasizing the importance of moral conduct, self-cultivation, social harmony, and the practice of proper governance.\n\nThe Five Classics, on the other hand, are a collection of ancient Chinese texts that were traditionally believed to be compiled or edited by Confucius himself. These classics include the Book of Changes (I Ching), the Book of Poetry (Shi Jing), the Book of Documents (Shu Jing), the Book of Rites (Li Ji), and the Spring and Autumn Annals (Chunqiu).\n\nBy studying these texts, scholars were expected to develop a deep understanding of Confucian values and principles, which were considered essential for serving in governmental positions during the Ming Dynasty. The Four Books and the Five Classics laid the foundation for learning proper ethics, governance, history, literature, and other aspects of Chinese culture, all of which were vital for aspiring officials.\n\nThus, the Four Books and the Five Classics were the books that scholars in the Ming Dynasty needed to read in order to pass the imperial examinations and pursue a career in the government."}, "correct": true, "pred": 3, "probs": [0.04061655327677727, 0.01802348531782627, 0.016931498423218727, 0.9244284629821777], "golden_prob": 0.9244284629821777, "pred_prob": 0.9244284629821777, "output": 3}
