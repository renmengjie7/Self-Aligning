However, CAI Lun's significant contribution was the refinement and standardization of papermaking techniques. He experimented with different materials, primarily mulberry bark, and developed a process that involved breaking down the fibers, mixing them with water, and then pressing and drying the resulting pulp into thin sheets.\n\nThese techniques not only improved the quality and appearance of paper but also made the production process more efficient and scalable. CAI Lun's advancements in papermaking led to the widespread use of paper as a writing material, facilitating the spread of knowledge, education, and communication.

Improved papermaking techniques.\n\nCAI Lun, also known as Ts'ai Lun, was a Chinese court official during the Eastern Han Dynasty. He is credited with inventing papermaking in the early 2nd century AD. However, it is important to note that while he is attributed as the inventor of paper, it was mainly through his improvements and innovations in existing papermaking techniques that he gained recognition and respect.\n\nPrior to CAI Lun, there were already various forms of paper-like materials made from plant fibers in different regions of the world. However, CAI Lun's significant contribution was the refinement and standardization of papermaking techniques. He experimented with different materials, primarily mulberry bark, and developed a process that involved breaking down the fibers, mixing them with water, and then pressing and drying the resulting pulp into thin sheets.\n\nThese techniques not only improved the quality and appearance of paper but also made the production process more efficient and scalable. CAI Lun's advancements in papermaking led to the widespread use of paper as a writing material, facilitating the spread of knowledge, education, and communication. This breakthrough had a profound impact not only in China but also across the world, shaping the course of history and civilization.\n\nTherefore, CAI Lun is highly respected and revered globally because of his significant improvements in papermaking techniques, which revolutionized the way written information was recorded and transmitted."}, "correct": false, "pred": 0, "probs": [0.8184173703193665, 0.07612467557191849, 0.046171948313713074, 0.059285957366228104], "golden_prob": 0.07612467557191849, "pred_prob": 0.8184173703193665, "output": 1}

As part of this transformation, Japan sought to expand its influence and acquire territories beyond its borders. The Japanese government believed in the concept of a Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, which aimed to establish Japanese dominance and control over East Asia.\n\nThe Sino-Japanese War, which took place from 1894 to 1895, was one of Japan's initial steps towards achieving this goal. The war was fought primarily over the control of Korea, which was then under Qing Dynasty's influence. By defeating China in the war, Japan aimed to not only conquer Korea but also weaken China's dominance in the region.\n\nHowever, Japan's ambitions went beyond just Korea and China. The war also revealed Japan's aspiration to assert itself as a global power. Japan's swift victory over China greatly surprised Western powers at the time, who had previously considered Japan to be a weaker and less developed nation. This victory established Japan as a rising power and instilled the country with a sense of imperialistic confidence.\n\nThe Sino-Japanese War served as a demonstration of Japan's military capabilities and its ability to challenge established powers. It showcased Japan's ambition to become a dominant force not only in East Asia but also on the global stage.

As part of this transformation, Japan sought to expand its influence and acquire territories beyond its borders. The Japanese government believed in the concept of a Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, which aimed to establish Japanese dominance and control over East Asia.\n\nThe Sino-Japanese War, which took place from 1894 to 1895, was one of Japan's initial steps towards achieving this goal. The war was fought primarily over the control of Korea, which was then under Qing Dynasty's influence. By defeating China in the war, Japan aimed to not only conquer Korea but also weaken China's dominance in the region.\n\nHowever, Japan's ambitions went beyond just Korea and China. The war also revealed Japan's aspiration to assert itself as a global power. Japan's swift victory over China greatly surprised Western powers at the time, who had previously considered Japan to be a weaker and less developed nation. This victory established Japan as a rising power and instilled the country with a sense of imperialistic confidence.\n\nThe Sino-Japanese War served as a demonstration of Japan's military capabilities and its ability to challenge established powers. It showcased Japan's ambition to become a dominant force not only in East Asia but also on the global stage. While the explicit objective of dominating the world may not have been stated by Japan during the war, its actions and subsequent events in history provide evidence of this broader aim.\n\nIn summary, the ultimate aim of the Sino-Japanese War launched by Japan was to \"Dominate the world.\" This aim can be understood by considering the historical context, Japan's imperialistic ambitions, and the subsequent events that unfolded in the years following the war."}, "correct": false, "pred": 1, "probs": [0.08103980123996735, 0.7688842415809631, 0.05232322961091995, 0.09775266796350479], "golden_prob": 0.05232322961091995, "pred_prob": 0.7688842415809631, "output": 2}

This resentment can fuel rebellion and destabilize the dynasty's power structure.\n\nTherefore, the reign of a clumsy and cruel last king can be seen as a common cause for the demise of the Xia, Shang, and Western Zhou Dynasties, as it would have contributed to internal strife, rebellion, and the loss of support and legitimacy from both the ruling elite and the general population."}, "correct": false, "pred": 1, "probs": [0.10239271074533463, 0.7565854787826538, 0.07491210848093033, 0.06610970199108124], "golden_prob": 0.07491210848093033, "pred_prob": 0.7565854787826538, "output": 2}

They also confiscated and destroyed British opium stocks, leading to tensions between the two countries.\n\nBritain, now the dominant industrial power, saw the Chinese ban as a threat to its trade and economic interests. As a result, Britain launched the Opium War in an attempt to force China to open its markets to British goods and reverse the trade deficit. The war ultimately resulted in British victory and the signing of the unfair Treaty of Nanjing, which granted Britain greater access to Chinese markets and territory.\n\nTherefore, the main reason why Britain was the first to launch the Opium War against China was its completion of the Industrial Revolution, which made it the number one power and motivated it to safeguard its economic interests and expand its trade networks."}, "correct": false, "pred": 0, "probs": [0.7274271845817566, 0.16231094300746918, 0.023383108898997307, 0.08687879145145416], "golden_prob": 0.08687879145145416, "pred_prob": 0.7274271845817566, "output": 3}

British forces, with their superior military technology, inflicted several defeats on the Chinese and forced them to sign the Treaty of Nanking in 1842.\n\nThe Treaty of Nanking marked a significant turning point in China's history as it opened several treaty ports to foreign powers, including British, French, and American traders. These treaty ports allowed Western powers to establish a presence in China and engage in trade. It can be considered the starting point of China's engagement with modern capitalism.\n\nFollowing the Treaty of Nanking, other Western nations also sought similar treaties and established their presence in China. The Sino-French War (1884-1885) and the Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895) were both conflicts in which China faced military conflicts with foreign powers. While these wars had significant implications for China's political and territorial situation, they did not directly contribute to the establishment of factories by modern capitalist countries in China.\n\nIt was after the Opium War that Western powers started to set up factories and industries in China, taking advantage of the unequal treaties and the more favorable conditions for foreign trade and investment.

Their religious ideology, known as the Congregation of God, emphasized the worship of a single God and adherence to their own set of scriptures, which were believed to be the true word of God.\n\nBy declaring the Confucian scriptures and other classical texts as \"demon books heresy\" and prohibiting their teaching and spreading, the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom aimed to distance themselves from traditional Chinese culture and established Confucian beliefs. They saw these texts as incompatible with their own religious teachings and wanted to eradicate their influence from their society.\n\nThis decision was not guided by scientific theories, as option A suggests. It was primarily a religious and ideological choice to promote their own doctrine and establish their own cultural identity.\n\nSimilarly, option C, which suggests that the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom had completely escaped the influence of the Confucian classics, is also correct to some extent.

The invention of paper provided a more affordable, accessible, and efficient medium for recording, storing, and disseminating information.\n\nThe availability of paper revolutionized education, communication, and the spread of knowledge. It facilitated the printing of books, making written knowledge much more accessible to a larger population. This, in turn, led to the preservation and dissemination of literary works, scientific discoveries, historical records, and religious texts.\n\nThe widespread use of paper also led to advancements in other areas of civilization. It facilitated the development of bureaucracy, as official documents, legal codes, and administrative records could be produced more efficiently. It also contributed to the growth of trade, as written contracts, receipts, and bills of sale could be easily created.\n\nFurthermore, the invention of paper had significant cultural and artistic implications. It enabled the creation of beautiful calligraphy, paintings, and drawings, contributing to the development of Chinese art and aesthetics.\n\nOverall, the invention of papermaking by the ancient Chinese had a lasting influence on the development of civilization, significantly impacting education, communication, bureaucracy, trade, and the arts."}, "correct": false, "pred": 2, "probs": [0.10805283486843109, 0.11502164602279663, 0.6619038581848145, 0.11502164602279663], "golden_prob": 0.11502164602279663, "pred_prob": 0.6619038581848145, "output": 1}

China, once considered the \"Middle Kingdom\" and the dominant power in East Asia, was now being dominated and defeated by a smaller, newly industrialized country like Japan.\n\nThe defeat in the Sino-Japanese War led to a growing sense of national humiliation and the realization that China needed to modernize and strengthen itself to protect its interests. It sparked a wave of nationalist sentiment and a desire for change among the Chinese people.\n\nThe poem mentioned in the question, which talks about serving the country with knowledge of scholars, reflects the emerging intellectual and political movement in China during this period. Scholars, intellectuals, and reformists began to advocate for modernization, democratic reforms, and the establishment of a stronger and more united China.\n\nOverall, the Sino-Japanese War served as a catalyst for the awakening of national consciousness among the Chinese people. It emphasized the need for change, modernization, and the pursuit of national interests, leading to the rise of various ideological and political movements in the late Qing Dynasty."}, "correct": false, "pred": 0, "probs": [0.6508660316467285, 0.18647624552249908, 0.034494634717702866, 0.12816312909126282], "golden_prob": 0.034494634717702866, "pred_prob": 0.6508660316467285, "output": 2}

Launching the euro.\n\nThe Maastricht Treaty, signed in 1992, is a significant milestone in European history because it established the framework for the creation of the European Union (EU) and introduced the single currency known as the euro.

The CFSP primarily aimed at coordinating foreign policy among EU member states rather than military integration.\n\nOption C, proposing a customs union and a common agricultural policy, is incorrect because these elements were already in place before the Maastricht Treaty.

During the 18th and 19th centuries, China had strict trade policies that limited foreign access to its markets. Britain, in particular, had a trade imbalance with China as it imported large quantities of goods like tea but had limited export opportunities. \n\nIn order to address this trade imbalance, British merchants began smuggling opium into China. Opium was an addictive drug that was highly sought after in China, and its illegal trade became significant. This caused widespread addiction among the Chinese population and depleted China's silver reserves as they paid for the opium with silver.\n\nIn an attempt to stop this illegal trade and protect their citizens, the Chinese government cracked down on the opium trade, leading to conflicts with Britain. The British saw this as an opportunity to break China's trade barriers and gain access to its markets.

During the 18th and 19th centuries, China had strict trade policies that limited foreign access to its markets. Britain, in particular, had a trade imbalance with China as it imported large quantities of goods like tea but had limited export opportunities. \n\nIn order to address this trade imbalance, British merchants began smuggling opium into China. Opium was an addictive drug that was highly sought after in China, and its illegal trade became significant. This caused widespread addiction among the Chinese population and depleted China's silver reserves as they paid for the opium with silver.\n\nIn an attempt to stop this illegal trade and protect their citizens, the Chinese government cracked down on the opium trade, leading to conflicts with Britain. The British saw this as an opportunity to break China's trade barriers and gain access to its markets. They waged war against China, starting the First Opium War in 1839.\n\nThe result of this war was the Treaty of Nanking in 1842, which imposed several terms on China, including the opening of five treaty ports (including Shanghai), granting Britain extraterritoriality (meaning their citizens were subject to British laws and courts), and compensating Britain for the destroyed opium.

Therefore, believers are encouraged to submit to their destiny and rely on Allah's guidance rather than trying to control or struggle against their circumstances.\n\nChristianity also includes teachings related to enduring suffering, submitting to fate, and giving up personal struggles. Jesus Christ is portrayed in the Bible as someone who willingly endured suffering, and his followers are urged to emulate his example. Additionally, Christians are encouraged to surrender themselves to God's will and trust in His plans rather than relying solely on their own efforts.\n\nTherefore, the statement accurately captures certain shared characteristics and teachings of the three major religions."}, "correct": false, "pred": 2, "probs": [0.1235327497124672, 0.04544515907764435, 0.6273510456085205, 0.20367106795310974], "golden_prob": 0.1235327497124672, "pred_prob": 0.6273510456085205, "output": 0}

The Agricultural Transformation: This involved dismantling the collective farming system and introducing the household responsibility system, allowing farmers to have more control over their land and the profits they earned from it. This led to increased agricultural production and improved the living standards of rural communities.\n\n2. The Industrial Transformation: China introduced market-oriented reforms in the industrial sector, including liberalizing prices, decentralizing decision-making, and allowing the establishment of private enterprises. This led to greater efficiency, productivity, and innovation in industries, and helped China become a global manufacturing powerhouse.\n\n3. The Urban Transformation: This involved reforms in the urban areas, including the loosening of restrictions on migration, allowing people to move from rural areas to cities in search of better job opportunities. This led to the rapid urbanization of China and the growth of its cities.\n\nThe completion of these three major transformations marked a significant shift in China's economic system, from a centrally planned economy towards a more market-oriented socialist system. This period of reforms and transformations greatly contributed to China's economic growth and development, improving the living standards of its people and raising China's status in the world.", "raw": {"question": "\"Socialism is good, socialism is good, and people in socialist countries have a high status.\" The lyrics are a tribute to socialism.

In the Sui and Tang Dynasties, where the chiefs of the three provinces became prime ministers, this further consolidates power at the central level.

This approach emphasized the eradication of class differences and the establishment of a classless society.\n\nHowever, during the Third Plenary Session, there was a notable shift in the Party's focus. The session emphasized the importance of economic construction and development as the primary goal for the Party. This marked a departure from the previous emphasis on class struggle.

As part of this process, the government adopted a parliamentary system similar to that of European countries.\n\nIn this system, the Cabinet, which is composed of ministers responsible for various government departments, is appointed by the prime minister and is accountable to the parliament. However, unlike some Western parliamentary systems, the Cabinet in Japan during this time did not have a system of checks and balances on parliament.\n\nThis means that the Cabinet did not have a formal mechanism to limit or control the actions of the parliament. As a result, parliament had greater control and influence over the government's decisions and actions. The lack of a check on parliament gave the legislative body more power and authority in governing the country.\n\nOverall, the polity of Japan in the late 19th century was characterized by a Cabinet that had no check on parliament, allowing parliament to have a significant role in shaping and directing government policies and actions."}, "correct": false, "pred": 2, "probs": [0.20845583081245422, 0.09846755862236023, 0.5666416883468628, 0.12643484771251678], "golden_prob": 0.09846755862236023, "pred_prob": 0.5666416883468628, "output": 1}

This theory is based on the observation and analysis of the natural world and how it relates to human health and well-being.\n\nAccording to the theory, Yin and Yang are opposing yet complementary forces that exist in all aspects of life, including the human body and the natural environment. Yin represents the feminine, passive, cold, and dark aspects, while Yang represents the masculine, active, hot, and light aspects. These opposing forces are in constant flux and are believed to be the underlying principles of change and transformation.\n\nThe five elements, also known as the Five Phases or Five Agents, are Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal, and Water. These elements represent different aspects of the natural world and are believed to interact and influence one another in a cyclical manner.

Please explain why.\n    ", "output": "During the Jin Dynasty, the main reason for the formation of national unity was social and economic development and strengthening of the North. This is because during this period, the northern region of China experienced significant growth and development compared to the southern region. The Northern region became the center of power, attracting people, resources, and economic activities. \n\nThe Jin Dynasty implemented a series of reforms and policies that promoted economic development, such as agricultural advancements, irrigation projects, and the promotion of trade and commerce. These measures led to increased agricultural productivity, improved infrastructure, and the growth of urban centers in the Northern region. As a result, the North became economically prosperous, attracting people from various regions to migrate and settle there.\n\nAdditionally, the strengthening of the North was accompanied by the decline of the power of the powerful landlords. The centralization of power in the northern regions weakened the authority and influence of the powerful landlords, allowing for a more unified and centralized governance system. This led to greater political stability and the formation of national unity under the Jin Dynasty.\n\nOverall, the social and economic development, along with the strengthening of the North, played a crucial role in promoting national unity during the Jin Dynasty. The attractiveness of the Northern region in terms of economic opportunities and political stability resulted in the migration and exchange of peoples, further contributing to the formation of a unified and cohesive nation."}, "correct": false, "pred": 0, "probs": [0.5364816188812256, 0.15370456874370575, 0.17417007684707642, 0.13564379513263702], "golden_prob": 0.17417007684707642, "pred_prob": 0.5364816188812256, "output": 2}

Foreigners can set up factories in China.\n\nThe Treaty of Nanjing, signed in 1842 between China and Britain, marked the end of the First Opium War. This treaty forced China to cede Hong Kong to Britain and opened up several treaty ports to international trade. Additionally, it imposed a heavy indemnity on China, requiring them to pay reparations to Britain.\n\nThe Treaty of Shimonoseki, signed in 1895 between China and Japan, marked the end of the First Sino-Japanese War. This treaty imposed harsh terms on China, including the cession of Taiwan, the Pescadores Islands, and the Liaodong Peninsula to Japan. However, the new content introduced in the Treaty of Shimonoseki was the provision that allowed foreigners (not just Japanese) to set up factories in China.\n\nThis provision was significant because it further opened China to foreign influence and control over its economic activities. It allowed for increased foreign investment and exploitation of China's resources, thereby contributing to its loss of sovereignty and economic dominance by external powers.\n\nTherefore, when comparing the Treaty of Nanjing and the Treaty of Shimonoseki, the new content of the latter that distinguishes it from the former is the provision allowing foreigners to set up factories in China (option D)."}, "correct": false, "pred": 0, "probs": [0.5307671427726746, 0.07183152437210083, 0.23552648723125458, 0.16187484562397003], "golden_prob": 0.16187484562397003, "pred_prob": 0.5307671427726746, "output": 3}

The differing ideologies and interests between the Soviet Union and the Western countries, particularly the United States, led to disagreements and tensions in how these issues should be resolved.

In the feudal society of ancient China, the aristocracy held immense power and privilege, while the common farmers and peasants often faced exploitation and were denied the benefits of their own labor. Shang Yang sought to address this issue by instituting a policy where farming was rewarded.

This period in Chinese history was marked by a long period of instability, where the country was divided into multiple states, each with its own ruling power. The collapse of the previous dynasty, the Han Dynasty, led to a power vacuum and the emergence of several competing states.\n\nDuring this time, various rulers and states vied for control and dominance over the others. The constant struggles for power and territorial expansion eventually led to the establishment of three major states: the Western Jin Dynasty, the Southern and Northern Dynasties, and the Eastern Jin Dynasty. These three states represented distinct regions and had their own political structures and rulers.\n\nHowever, despite the division and separation of political power, there was also an effort to integrate the different states and bring about national unity. Several rulers attempted to reunify China under their own rule, leading to various military campaigns and alliances. These efforts ultimately led to the eventual reunification of China under the Sui Dynasty.\n\nTherefore, the characteristics of the three states, the Jin and the Southern and Northern Dynasties, can be categorized as the separation of political power as different states emerged and competed for control, but also the eventual great national integration as efforts were made to reunify China."}, "correct": false, "pred": 1, "probs": [0.13254790008068085, 0.5242370963096619, 0.06261119246482849, 0.28060391545295715], "golden_prob": 0.28060391545295715, "pred_prob": 0.5242370963096619, "output": 3}

The focus shifted from traditional occupations to wealth accumulation through trade and commerce.

This meant that China missed out on opportunities for trade, exchange of ideas, and technological advancements that were taking place globally.\n\nThe Qing Dynasty's policy of isolation, which limited foreign trade and interaction with other countries, prevented the Chinese from accessing new technologies, advancements, and economic opportunities that were progressing in other parts of the world. As a result, China fell behind in terms of industrialization, modernization, and economic development.\n\nWhile this policy was aimed at protecting China from Western influence and maintaining their traditional feudal structure, it ultimately prevented China from keeping pace with the global trends and advancements that were shaping other nations during this time. This lag in development had long-term consequences for China and impacted its ability to compete economically, militarily, and culturally on the world stage."}, "correct": false, "pred": 1, "probs": [0.12996983528137207, 0.5140406489372253, 0.16688455641269684, 0.18910498917102814], "golden_prob": 0.16688455641269684, "pred_prob": 0.5140406489372253, "output": 2}
