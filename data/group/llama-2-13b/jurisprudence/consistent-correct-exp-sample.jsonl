In the context of the Western Zhou Dynasty, this system played a significant role in the creation and maintenance of vassal states.\n\nBy delegating power and authority to these vassals, the central government was able to establish a hierarchical system of governance. The rulers of the Zhou Dynasty granted tracts of land, known as fiefs, to the nobles who were considered loyal and supportive.

In order to effectively implement this principle, it is essential to take into account several factors, which are ecological stability, economic development, and social harmony.\n\n1. Ecological stability: Protecting species is crucial for maintaining the ecological stability of an ecosystem. Each species plays a specific role in the ecosystem, and their interactions with other species and the environment contribute to maintaining the overall balance. By implementing species protection measures, we can prevent the loss or decline of key species, which can have cascading effects on the entire ecosystem.\n\n2. Economic development: While the protection of species may involve certain restrictions or regulations, it is important to strike a balance with economic development. Sustainable economic growth can coexist with species protection by incorporating conservation measures into development plans. This approach ensures that economic activities are conducted in a manner that minimizes harm to species and their habitats, thereby promoting long-term economic sustainability.\n\n3. Social harmony: Species protection is not just an environmental issue; it also has social dimensions. The well-being of human communities is closely linked to the health and functioning of ecosystems. Protecting species ensures the provision of essential ecosystem services, such as clean water, air, and soil fertility, which are crucial for human well-being.

This system allowed the Zhou dynasty to expand its influence and consolidate power by granting land and titles to its loyal relatives, who would then serve as subordinates and administrators of those territories. \n\nTherefore, based on the information provided in \"Zuo Zhuan\" and the historical context of the Western Zhou administration, the correct answer is \"The system of enfeoffment.\""}, "correct": true, "pred": 3, "probs": [0.1253580003976822, 0.08615721017122269, 0.06709930300712585, 0.7213854789733887], "golden_prob": 0.7213854789733887, "pred_prob": 0.7213854789733887, "output": 3}

Without a stable and prosperous economy, it would be difficult to achieve progress in other areas. \n\n② Political construction provides political guarantee for economic, cultural, and social construction. Political stability and effective governance are essential for creating a favorable environment for economic growth, the preservation and promotion of culture, and the establishment of social programs. A stable and well-functioning political system provides the necessary framework and policies that support other types of development. \n\n③ Cultural construction provides spiritual motivation and intellectual support for economic, political, and social construction. Cultural development plays a crucial role in motivating individuals, fostering a sense of identity and belonging, and shaping values and behaviors. These cultural factors can have a significant impact on economic productivity, political participation, and social cohesion. \n\n④ Social construction provides favorable social conditions for economic, political, and cultural construction. A harmonious and inclusive society, with strong social cohesion and a healthy social fabric, is beneficial for economic development, effective political participation, and the promotion and preservation of culture.

Legal effect of labor contract.\"\n\nLabor law is a branch of law that deals with the legal rights and obligations of employers and employees within the workplace. It governs various aspects such as employment contracts, working conditions, wages, benefits, and the resolution of disputes between employers and employees.\n\nThe legal effect of a labor contract refers to the consequences and obligations that arise from entering into a contract of employment. It encompasses the rights and responsibilities of both the employer and the employee, including matters such as the duration of the contract, termination conditions, notice periods, and any restrictions or obligations on both parties.\n\nIn civil and commercial law, labor contracts are considered to be agreements between two parties that create legal obligations.

It was a widespread uprising against the Qing Dynasty, which was the last imperial dynasty ruling over China. The revolution marked the end of more than two thousand years of feudal monarchy in China and led to the establishment of the Republic of China.\n\nThe Xinhai Revolution was primarily a result of various factors, including economic decline, social unrest, and political dissatisfaction. Chinese society was facing numerous challenges, including corruption, foreign imperialism, and the failure of the Qing government to modernize and address the needs of its people.\n\nThis revolution gained support from a broad range of people, including intellectuals, students, military officials, and local militias.

The land and mu System and the Senior Minister's New Chapter were proposed as potential solutions to address these issues. However, they failed to materialize because they did not take into account the social circumstances and needs of China at that time.\n\nDivorced from the social reality means that the proposals were disconnected from the actual conditions, demands, and aspirations of the people and society at large. They likely neglected to consider key factors such as prevalent social structures, economic realities, cultural norms, and political dynamics. As a result, these proposals were unable to gain sufficient support or implementation.\n\nIn order for any proposal or system to succeed, it must align with and address the existing social reality. Failure to do so often leads to rejection or inability to implement the proposed changes effectively.

Class contradictions arose between the slave-owning class and the slave class.\n\nFeudal society followed ancient slave society and was characterized by feudal relations of production. The mode of production was based on the ownership of land by a feudal lord, who leased out portions of land to peasants in exchange for their labor.

The formulation of Chinese nationality law was propelled by the awakening of national consciousness, which occurred gradually under national crisis. \n\nOption A, \"The Revolution of 1911 promoted national identity,\" is not the correct answer because although the revolution may have contributed to the development of national identity, it does not directly explain why the Chinese students put forward suggestions for the formulation of Chinese nationality law.\n\nOption B, \"Foreign shocks promote the construction of China's legal system,\" is not the correct answer because there is no mention of foreign shocks in the question. The focus of the question is on the factors that led to the suggestions for the formulation of Chinese nationality law, not the construction of the broader legal system.\n\nOption C, \"Anti-Qing nationalist sentiment is growing,\" is not the correct answer because although anti-Qing nationalist sentiment may have played a role, it does not fully address the phenomenon described in the question. The question references articles about nationality and the urgency to enact nationality laws, which suggests a broader awakening of national consciousness beyond just anti-Qing sentiment.\n\nOption D, \"National consciousness gradually awakens under national crisis,\" is the correct answer because it aligns with the main reason stated in the question. The formulation of Chinese nationality law was a response to the growing national crisis, which led to an awakening of national consciousness among Chinese students. The urgency to enact nationality laws reflected the need to define and protect Chinese national identity amid the challenges and crises faced by the country at that time."}, "correct": true, "pred": 3, "probs": [0.08428074419498444, 0.07437749952077866, 0.17842234671115875, 0.6629194021224976], "golden_prob": 0.6629194021224976, "pred_prob": 0.6629194021224976, "output": 3}

This is because during the latter years of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912), China experienced a series of military defeats and territorial concessions at the hands of foreign powers. These foreign powers, such as Britain, France, Russia, and Japan, took advantage of China's weakened state and forced unequal treaties upon the Qing government, which allowed them to control certain areas and exploit China's resources.\n\nAs a result, the Qing government was seen as weak and subservient to foreign interests, as it was unable to adequately defend China's sovereignty.

This means that society is continually advancing and progressing in terms of its ability to produce goods and services. \n\nMarxist theory argues that the economic base of society, which includes the means of production (such as factories, machinery, and technology), is the foundation upon which the political and social superstructure is built. As the productive forces develop, it leads to changes in the economic base, which in turn influences the political and social systems.\n\nHistorical materialism posits that throughout history, societies have progressed through different economic stages, such as feudalism and capitalism, driven by changes in the productive forces.
