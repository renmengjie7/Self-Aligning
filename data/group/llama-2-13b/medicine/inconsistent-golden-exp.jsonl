Patients with silicosis should have yearly purified protein derivative (PPD) tuberculin testing; a patient with positive reactive PPD (> 10 mm) should get isoniazid (INH) prophylaxis for 9 months.Extra MileCauses of interstitial lung disease (ILD)CauseDiseaseAsbestosAsbestosisGlass workers, mining, sandblasting, brickyardsSilicosisCoal workerCoal worker's pneumoconiosisCottonByssinosisElectronics, ceramics, fluorescent light bulbsBerylliosisMercuryPulmonary fibrosis", "cop": 1, "opa": "Mica worker", "opb": "Sugarcane worker", "opc": "Cotton industry workers", "opd": "Coal mine workers", "subject_name": "Medicine", "topic_name": "Respiratory", "id": "75227ca7-81ab-40dd-93de-1d3ffbc5add7", "choice_type": "single"}, "correct": false, "pred": 3, "probs": [0.025698725134134293, 0.030998578295111656, 0.03739142045378685, 0.9059112668037415], "golden_prob": 0.025698725134134293, "pred_prob": 0.9059112668037415, "output": 0}

It was then modified to distinguish fetal hemoglobin from maternal hemoglobin in blood samples from any source.* The Apt test may be used in cases of vaginal bleeding late during pregnancy (in cases of APH) to determine if the bleeding is from the mother or the fetus.* A positive test would indicate that blood is of fetal origin, and could be due to vasa previa. A negative test indicates that the blood is of maternal origin. In practice, the Apt test is almost never done when there is bleeding PV and a suspicion of vasa previa, because the time to fetal collapse with bleeding from vasa previa is often very short.* The test is based on the differences in the chemical properties between maternal and fetal hemoglobin. Adult hemoglobin is susceptible to alkaline denaturation whereas the fetal hemoglobin is resistant to it. The blood specimen is exposed to sodium hydroxide (NaOH) which will denature the adult hemoglobin but not the fetal hemoglobin. Under the microscope, the fetal hemoglobin will appear as a pinkish color while the adult hemoglobin will appear as a yellow-brownish color.* Other uses of APT test: If the newborn has blood in vomiting, or stools, or active bleeding from the nasogastric tube; a positive Apt test would mean that the bleeding is from the neonate. A negative Apt test would indicate that the blood is of maternal origin, suggesting that the neonate swallowed or aspirated maternal blood, either during delivery or during breastfeeding (e.g. from breast fissures).* The Kleihauer- Betke (KB) test, is a blood test used to measure the amount of fetal hemoglobin transferred from a fetus to a mothers bloodstream (to quantify the fetomaternal hemorrhage).

While bright red lower GI bleeding tends to indicate lower GI bleeding (bleeding distal to the ligament of Treitz), brisk upper GI bleeding can also be the source.

The differential diagnosis for painless hematochezia includes AV malformations, gastric erosions, esophageal varices, esophagitis, duodenal or gastric ulcer, hemorrhoids, diveiculosis, and colonic neoplasm. Diveiculitis occurs when a colonic outpouching or diveiculum becomes inflamed. Patients tend to be elderly and present with fever, abdominal pain, and abdominal tenderness on examination. While painful, these lesions do not bleed significantly (unlike their uninflamed counterpas in diveiculosis).

While bright red lower GI bleeding tends to indicate lower GI bleeding (bleeding distal to the ligament of Treitz), brisk upper GI bleeding can also be the source. The clinical manifestations of such bleeding range from negligible to hemodynamic instability, depending upon the rate of bleeding. The differential diagnosis for painless hematochezia includes AV malformations, gastric erosions, esophageal varices, esophagitis, duodenal or gastric ulcer, hemorrhoids, diveiculosis, and colonic neoplasm. Diveiculitis occurs when a colonic outpouching or diveiculum becomes inflamed. Patients tend to be elderly and present with fever, abdominal pain, and abdominal tenderness on examination.

Instead, immunoglobulin-coated red blood cells are removed by splenic macrophages that recognize the Fc portion of the immunoglobulin. These warm IgG antibodies are found in patients with malignant tumors, especially leukemia-lymphoma; they are associated with the use of such drugs as C-methyldopa\\ and they are also found in the autoimmune diseases, especially lupus erythematosus.> Cold-antibody autoimmune hemolytic anemia (cold AIHA) is subdivided into two clinical categories based on the type of anti- bodies involved.

In the skin, the disease causes palpable purpura (small, raised areas of bleeding underneath the skin), often with joint pain and abdominal pain. With kidney involvement, there may be a loss of small amounts of blood and protein in the urine (hematuria and proteinuria), but this usually goes unnoticed; in a small propoion of cases, the kidney involvement proceeds to chronic kidney disease. HSP is often preceded by an infection, such as a throat infection HSP is a systemic vasculitis (inflammation of blood vessels) and is characterized by deposition of immune complexes containing the antibody immunoglobulin A (IgA); the exact cause for this phenomenon is unknown. In children, it usually resolves within several weeks and requires no treatment apa from symptom control but may relapse in a third of cases and cause irreversible kidney damage in about one in a hundred cases. In adults, the prognosis is different from in children. The average duration of cutaneous lesions is 27.9 months.For many, it tends to be relapsing-remitting over a long period of time, rather than self-limiting and there tend to be more complications sogns and symptoms: Purpura, ahritis, and abdominal pain are known as the \"classic triad\" of Henoch-Schonlein purpura. Purpura occur in all cases, joint pains and ahritis in 80%, and abdominal pain in 62%. Some include gastrointestinal hemorrhage as a fouh criterion; this occurs in 33% of cases, sometimes, but not necessarily always, due to intussusception. The purpura typically appear on the legs and buttocks, but may also be seen on the arms, face and trunk. The abdominal pain is colicky in character, and may be accompanied by nausea, vomiting, constipation or diarrhea. There may be blood or mucus in the stools.The joints involved tend to be the ankles, knees, and elbows, but ahritis in the hands and feet is possible; the ahritis is nonerosive and hence causes no permanent deformity.Foy percent have evidence of kidney involvement, mainly in the form of hematuria (blood in the urine), but only a quaer will have this in sufficient quantities to be noticeable without laboratory tests. Problems in other organs, such as the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) and lungs may occur, but is much less common than in the skin, bowel and kidneys. Of the 40% of patients who develop kidney involvement, almost all have evidence (visible or on urinalysis) of blood in the urine. More than half also have proteinuria (protein in the urine), which in one eighth is severe enough to cause nephrotic syndrome (generalised swelling due to low protein content of the blood). While abnormalities on urinalysis may continue for a long time, only 1% of all HSP patients develop chronic kidney disease. Hypeension (high blood pressure) may occur.

Other 'neurotic' symptoms such as anxiety, obsessive symptoms, phobic symptoms, and multiple somatic symptoms, are often present.4. Preoccupation with the stressful condition is common. Other common features include:1. The reactivity of mood is preserved, i.e. the patient is able to emotionally react to the events occurring in his surroundings.2. There may be insomnia or hypersomnia. There is usually difficulty in initiating sleep and sometimes difficulty in awakening in the morning.3. The mood may be worse in the evening, at the end of the day.4. Suicidal threats and gestures are more common than completed suicide. 82 Ref: A Sho Textbook of Psychiatry, Niraj Ahuja, 7th Edition, pg. no.", "cop": 3, "opa": "Major depression", "opb": "No psychiatric disorder", "opc": "Dysthymia", "opd": "Chronic fatique syndrome", "subject_name": "Psychiatry", "topic_name": "Mood disorders", "id": "b8f7f301-e84a-4b18-a143-288c2f005f71", "choice_type": "single"}, "correct": false, "pred": 0, "probs": [0.7019738554954529, 0.08924596756696701, 0.10765118151903152, 0.10112892836332321], "golden_prob": 0.10765118151903152, "pred_prob": 0.7019738554954529, "output": 2}

APS provokes blood clots (thrombosis) in both aeries and veins as well as pregnancy-related complications such as miscarriage, stillbih, preterm delivery, and severe preeclampsia. The diagnostic criteria require one clinical event (i.e. thrombosis or pregnancy complication) and two antibody blood tests spaced at least three months apa that confirm the presence of either lupus anticoagulant or anti-b2-glycoprotein-I (since b2-glycoprotein-I antibodies are a subset of anti-cardiolipin antibodies, an anti-cardiolipin assay can be performed as a less specific proxy) Antiphospholipid syndrome can be primary or secondary. Primary antiphospholipid syndrome occurs in the absence of any other related disease. Secondary antiphospholipid syndrome occurs with other autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). In rare cases, APS leads to rapid organ failure due to generalised thrombosis; this is termed \"catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome\" (CAPS or Asherson syndrome) and is associated with a high risk of death. Antiphospholipid syndrome often requires treatment with anticoagulant medication such as heparin to reduce the risk of fuher episodes of thrombosis and improve the prognosis of pregnancy. Warfarin/Coumadin is not used during pregnancy because it can cross the placenta, unlike heparin, and is teratogenic. The presence of antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) in the absence of blood clots or pregnancy-related complications does not indicate APS (see below for the diagnosis of APS). Antiphospholipid syndrome can cause aerial or venous blood clots, in any organ system, or pregnancy-related complications. In APS patients, the most common venous event is deep vein thrombosis of the lower extremities, and the most common aerial event is stroke. In pregnant women affected by APS, there is an increased risk of recurrent miscarriage, intrauterine growth restriction, and preterm bih.A frequent cause of such complications is placental infarctions. In some cases, APS seems to be the leading cause of mental and/or development retardation in the newborn, due to an aPL-induced inhibition of trophoblast differentiation. The antiphospholipid syndrome responsible for most of the miscarriages in later trimesters seen in concomitant systemic lupus erythematosus and pregnancy. Other common findings, although not pa of the APS classification criteria, are low platelet count, hea valve disease, and livedo reticularis.

Which of following is the clinical diagnosis -", "choices": ["Appendicitis", "Leukemic colitis", "Perforation peritonitis", "Neutropenic colitis"], "answer": 3, "explanation": "Neutropenic enterocolitis (NE) is also known as typhlitis, ileocecal syndrome, cecitis, or necrotizing enterocolitis. Despite the previous use of the term \"necrotizing enterocolitis\" to describe NE cases, necrotizing enterocolitis is a different inflammatory illness seen in newborns and is beyond the scope of this review. NE is a clinical entity initially described in leukemic pediatric patients. It has also been repoed in adults with hematologic malignancies such as leukemia, lymphoma, multiple myeloma, aplastic anemia, and myelodysplastic syndromes, as well as other immunosuppressive causes such as AIDS, therapy for solid tumors, and organ transplant. The true incidence of NE is unknown. One systematic review published in 2005 suggested a pooled incidence of 5.6% in hospitalized adults with hematological malignancies, chemotherapy for solid tumors, and aplastic anemia. The repoed moality also varies with rates as high as 50%. NE was repoed initially after the use of taxane drugs, but more recently an increasing number of chemotherapeutic drugs have been implicated. Other drugs linked to NE include cytosine arabinoside, gemcitabine, vincristine, doxorubicin, gemcitabine, cyclophosphamide, 5-fluorouracil, leuvocorin, and daunorubicin. Immunosuppressive therapy for organ transplant, antibiotics, and sulfasalazine for the treatment of rheumatoid ahritis have also been considered causes of NE. PATHOGENESIS The exact pathogenesis of NE is not completely understood. The main elements in disease onset appear to be intestinal mucosal injury together with neutropenia and the immunocompromised state of the afflicted patients. These initial conditions lead to intestinal edema, engorged vessels, and a disrupted mucosal surface, which becomes more vulnerable to bacterial intramural invasion. Chemotherapeutic agents can cause direct mucosal injury (mucositis) or can predispose to distension and necrosis, thereby altering intestinal motility. Cytosine arabinoside (cytarabine) is a chemotherapeutic agent used to treat leukemia and lymphoma that is paicularly associated with the development of NE.

Prolactin is secreted in a pulsatile .fashion, the amplitude and frequency of which not only varies throughout the day but is also impacted upon by a variety of physiology stimuli i.e., suckling, stress and increased level of ovarian steroids primarily estrogens. \"The general view is that lactotrophs have spontaneously high secretary activity\". Therefore pituitary prolactin secretion is under a tonic and predominantly inhibitory control exeed by the hypothalamus. - Hypothalmus releases prolactin inhibitory factor (PIF) which inhibits prolactin release. - PIE is actually dopamine and it suppresses prolactin synthesis and secretion by means of D2 receptors. - These actions constitute the physiologic basis of therapeutic effect of dopamine agonists in hyperprolactinemia. Prolactin acts on the breast tissue where in the setting of estrogen priming, it stimulates lactation.

Estrogens and thyroid hormones have opposite effects on PRL synthesis and release. - \"Estrogen increases prolactin levelQ by acting at both pituitary and hypothalamic level\" - At pituitary level it increases prolactin secretion by controlling PRL gene expression and modifying its sensitivity to physiological stimuli. - At hypothalamic level it inhibits the activity of all three types of hypothalamic neuroendocrine dopaminergic neurone. - Low thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) levels increase TRH-induced PRL secretion, whereas high T4 and T3 levels inhibit PRL mRNA accumulation and release.

The affinity between carbon monoxide and hemoglobin is 240 times stronger than the affinity between hemoglobin and oxygen. CO binds to hemoglobin, producing carboxyhemoglobin (COHb), which decreases the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood. This inhibits the transpo, delivery, and utilization of oxygen. This causes hemoglobin to retain oxygen that would otherwise be delivered to the tissue. Levels of oxygen available for tissue use are decreased.

The choice of treatment often depends on how advanced the cancer is and whether or not it has orable features. In early disease a cure is often possible. The percentage of people who survive five years in the United States is 86%. For those under the age of 20 rates of survival are 97%.

Bacteria and plants use photosynthetic energy to reduce carbon dioxide expending water. The organisms that can use CO2 as a sole source of carbon are termed autotrophs. Chemolithotrophs are organisms that use an inorganic substrate, such as hydrogen or thiosulfate, as a reductant and CO2 a carbon source. Heterotrophs require organic carbon for growth. Many organisms possess the ability to assimilate nitrate (NO.3) and nitrite (NO2) reductively by conveing these forms to ammonia (NH3). Dissimilation pathways are taken by microorganisms that use these ions as terminal electron acceptors in respiration. This process is known as denitrification, with the final product being nitrogen gas (N2). Fermentation is characterized by substrate phosphorylation, in which products such as glucose are involved for energy production. Autotrophs should not be confused with auxotrophs.

Over 80% of cases come from patients with a positive family history. The remainder arise as a result of new mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene on the sho arm of chromosome 5. FAP is inherited as an autosomal dominant condition and is consequently equally likely in men and women. The lifetime risk of colorectal cancer is 100% in patients with FAP. FAP can also be associated with benign mesodermal tumours such as desmoid tumours and osteomas. Epidermoid cysts can also occur (Gardner's syndrome); desmoid tumours in the abdomen spread locally to involve the intestinal mesentery and, although non-metastasising, they may become unresectable. Up to 50% of patients with FAP have congenital hyperophy of the retinal pigment epithelium (CHRPE), which can be used to screen affected families if genetic testing is unavailable. CLINICAL FEATURES Polyps are usually visible on sigmoidoscopy by the age of 15 years and will almost always be visible by the age of 30 years. Carcinoma of the large bowel develops 10-20 years after the onset of the polyposis. If there are no adenomas by the age of 30 years, FAP is unlikely. If the diagnosis is made duringadolescence, surgery is usually deferred to the age of 17 or 18 years unless symptoms develop. Malignant change is rare before the age of 20 years. Examination of blood relatives, including cousins, nephews and nieces, is essential; a family tree should be constructed and a register of affected families maintained.

Isoflurane and desflurane are not used for induction as they are more pungent and associated with more coughing 8c laryngospasm.Intravenous induction* Intravenous induction is preferred when induction by mask is contraindicated i.e., in full stomach patients or of child comes in the operation theatre with IV line in situ.* Thiopentol or propofol are commonly used agents. Propofol is particularly suitable for out patient surgery. Ketamine is preferred in children with hypovolemia. Etomidate can be used in child with unstable cardiovascular status as it is most cardio-vascular stable intravenous inducing agent.Maintenance* As sevoflurane cause emergence delirium and agitation, it is not used for maintenance. After induction with sevoflurane anaesthesia, isoflurane or Halothane are used for maintenance anaesthesia. During maintenance, anaesthetic gas mixture contain N2O+O2 +Halothane or isoflurane.

{"id": 28182, "question": "Which of the following is a Sign of ovulation?", "choices": ["Subnuclear vacuolation", "Thinning of germinal lining", "Proliferation of cortex", "Relatively loose endometrial stroma"], "answer": 0, "explanation": "Ans. A. Subnuclear vacuolation. (Ref. Williams9 Gync lst/Fig,15-20; Obstetrics Dutta 7th/pg. 17-18).The endometrial cycle follows the changes in the endometrium during the 'menstrual' cycle. It is divided into phases with characteristic histological changes:# Proliferative phase (pre-ovulatory) - can be though of as building the endometrium at the same time as the follicle is maturing for ovulation (need to grow before it can secrete)# Interval phase# Secretory (post-ovulatory)- can be thought of as preparing for implantation (secretory in order to support implantation)# Menstrual phaseProliferative PhaseThe glands are simple. Mitotic activity is conspicuous. In the endometrium, the proliferative activity occurs even before the complete cessation of menstruation, i.e. a few days into the cycle. The glands at this earlier stage are relatively straight or at most slightly coiled and are found within relatively loose endometrial stroma. There is brisk cell division with prominent mitotic activity in both the glands and the stroma. Under the influence of oestrogen, the stroma is often the thickest at day 10. After this, the rate of glandular growth relative to the stroma results in coiling of the glands as the cycle moves towards ovulation. The nuclei rather than central are pseudostratified, though they tend to be found in the basal half.Interval PhaseThe interval phase occurs over a short period of 24-48 hours. 1-2 days folllowing ovulation, there is peak of luteinizing hormone and increased progesterone, which brings on the secretory changes. The early interval phase is therefore indistinguishable from late proliferative phase without biochemical corrobation. The cut-off is somewhat arbitrary, but there may be a brief overlap of proliferative and secretory phase features, the latter manifest as subnuclear vacuolation.Secretory PhaseThe amount of subnuclear vacuolation is at its maximum in the early secretory phase (days 3-4 post-ovulation or days 17- 18 of the cycle) and are initially seen to line up giving the appearence of a line of vacuoles and a line nuclei. Mitotic activity is minimal as the glands are no longer dividing, but the cells dilate and become more tortuous. As the cycle moves into the mid-secretory phase, the vacuoles begin to be found above the nuclei as they head for the luminal surface.# Early secretory phase change. There are subnuclear vacuoles. The glands are beginning to become convoluted. Mitotic activity is now absent.# In the mid-secretory phase (days 5-11 post-ovulation or days 19-25 of the cycle), the glands remain dilated, but become more irregular with a papillary or saw-tooth appearence. The vacuoles move to a supranuclear position and the contents may be seen within the lumina. The stroma becomes looser and more oedematous, becoming most prominent at days 20-22. Day 21 is regarded as the optimal time for implantation. Decidualisation of the stroma also occurs.# In the late secretory phase (days 26-28), decidualisation extends from the surface to the deeper stroma. Lymphocytes being to appear.Menstrual PhaseIn the absence of conception, hCG is not produced and corpus luteum is unable to sustain itself. Withdrawal of progesterone causes the stroma to crumble, forming balls of deep blue stromal cells (with H&E staining). Secretions are also exhausted at this stage and the glands break off. Red blood cells and neutrophils are mixed between the involuting structures.OVULATIONDefinition: It is a process whereby a secondary oocyte is released form the ovary following the rupture of graafian follicle and becomes available for the conception.Mechanism: A. Changes in the follicle:a. Preovulatory enelargement of the Graafian follicle due to accumulation of follicular fluid and measures 20 mm in diameter.b. The cumulus oophorus separates separates from the rest of granulosa cells and floats freely in the antrum. The inner layer of cells surrounding the oocyte is arranged radially and is termed corona radiata. The stigma develops as a conical projection, which penetrates the outer surface layer of ovary. The cumulus escapes out of the follicle as a slow oozing process, taking about 1-2 minutes along with varying amount of follicular fluid.c. Changes in the oocyte: Prior to ovulation its cytoplasmic volume is increased along with chnages in the number and distribution of mitochondria and in the golgi apparatus. Completion of arrested first meiotic division occurs with extrusion of the fitrst polar body, each containing haploid number of chromosomes.Causes:# LH surge: Sustained peak level of estrogen for 24-36 hrs in the late follicular phase -LH surge occurs form anterior pituitary (persists for 24 hrs) - Ovulation occurs approx 24-36 hrs after LH surge ->LH surge stimulates completion of reducation division of the oocyte -^initiate leutinisation, synthesis of progesterone and pgs. IT IS THE BEST PREDICTOR OF OVULATION.# FSH rise: Preovulatory rise of progesterone facilitates the positive feedback action of estrogen to induce FSH surge a increase in plaminogen activator a plasminogen a plasmin a helps lysis of the walls of follicle. Thus, the combined LH/FSH midcycle surge is responsible for the final tage of maturation, rupture of the follicle, and expulsion of the oocyte.# Stretching factor# Contraction of micromuscles in the theca externa and ovarian stroma due to increased pg synthesis.", "raw": {"question": "Which of the following is a Sign of ovulation?", "exp": "Ans.

Mitotic activity is conspicuous. In the endometrium, the proliferative activity occurs even before the complete cessation of menstruation, i.e. a few days into the cycle. The glands at this earlier stage are relatively straight or at most slightly coiled and are found within relatively loose endometrial stroma. There is brisk cell division with prominent mitotic activity in both the glands and the stroma. Under the influence of oestrogen, the stroma is often the thickest at day 10. After this, the rate of glandular growth relative to the stroma results in coiling of the glands as the cycle moves towards ovulation. The nuclei rather than central are pseudostratified, though they tend to be found in the basal half.Interval PhaseThe interval phase occurs over a short period of 24-48 hours. 1-2 days folllowing ovulation, there is peak of luteinizing hormone and increased progesterone, which brings on the secretory changes. The early interval phase is therefore indistinguishable from late proliferative phase without biochemical corrobation. The cut-off is somewhat arbitrary, but there may be a brief overlap of proliferative and secretory phase features, the latter manifest as subnuclear vacuolation.Secretory PhaseThe amount of subnuclear vacuolation is at its maximum in the early secretory phase (days 3-4 post-ovulation or days 17- 18 of the cycle) and are initially seen to line up giving the appearence of a line of vacuoles and a line nuclei. Mitotic activity is minimal as the glands are no longer dividing, but the cells dilate and become more tortuous. As the cycle moves into the mid-secretory phase, the vacuoles begin to be found above the nuclei as they head for the luminal surface.# Early secretory phase change. There are subnuclear vacuoles. The glands are beginning to become convoluted. Mitotic activity is now absent.# In the mid-secretory phase (days 5-11 post-ovulation or days 19-25 of the cycle), the glands remain dilated, but become more irregular with a papillary or saw-tooth appearence. The vacuoles move to a supranuclear position and the contents may be seen within the lumina. The stroma becomes looser and more oedematous, becoming most prominent at days 20-22. Day 21 is regarded as the optimal time for implantation. Decidualisation of the stroma also occurs.# In the late secretory phase (days 26-28), decidualisation extends from the surface to the deeper stroma. Lymphocytes being to appear.Menstrual PhaseIn the absence of conception, hCG is not produced and corpus luteum is unable to sustain itself. Withdrawal of progesterone causes the stroma to crumble, forming balls of deep blue stromal cells (with H&E staining). Secretions are also exhausted at this stage and the glands break off. Red blood cells and neutrophils are mixed between the involuting structures.OVULATIONDefinition: It is a process whereby a secondary oocyte is released form the ovary following the rupture of graafian follicle and becomes available for the conception.Mechanism: A. Changes in the follicle:a. Preovulatory enelargement of the Graafian follicle due to accumulation of follicular fluid and measures 20 mm in diameter.b. The cumulus oophorus separates separates from the rest of granulosa cells and floats freely in the antrum. The inner layer of cells surrounding the oocyte is arranged radially and is termed corona radiata. The stigma develops as a conical projection, which penetrates the outer surface layer of ovary. The cumulus escapes out of the follicle as a slow oozing process, taking about 1-2 minutes along with varying amount of follicular fluid.c. Changes in the oocyte: Prior to ovulation its cytoplasmic volume is increased along with chnages in the number and distribution of mitochondria and in the golgi apparatus. Completion of arrested first meiotic division occurs with extrusion of the fitrst polar body, each containing haploid number of chromosomes.Causes:# LH surge: Sustained peak level of estrogen for 24-36 hrs in the late follicular phase -LH surge occurs form anterior pituitary (persists for 24 hrs) - Ovulation occurs approx 24-36 hrs after LH surge ->LH surge stimulates completion of reducation division of the oocyte -^initiate leutinisation, synthesis of progesterone and pgs. IT IS THE BEST PREDICTOR OF OVULATION.# FSH rise: Preovulatory rise of progesterone facilitates the positive feedback action of estrogen to induce FSH surge a increase in plaminogen activator a plasminogen a plasmin a helps lysis of the walls of follicle. Thus, the combined LH/FSH midcycle surge is responsible for the final tage of maturation, rupture of the follicle, and expulsion of the oocyte.# Stretching factor# Contraction of micromuscles in the theca externa and ovarian stroma due to increased pg synthesis.", "cop": 1, "opa": "Subnuclear vacuolation", "opb": "Thinning of germinal lining", "opc": "Proliferation of cortex", "opd": "Relatively loose endometrial stroma", "subject_name": "Gynaecology & Obstetrics", "topic_name": "Miscellaneous (Gynae)", "id": "3065d9df-afc6-4540-b444-e715814a2337", "choice_type": "single"}, "correct": false, "pred": 3, "probs": [0.17230601608753204, 0.1952483057975769, 0.06747600436210632, 0.5649696588516235], "golden_prob": 0.17230601608753204, "pred_prob": 0.5649696588516235, "output": 0}

Diagnosis is:", "choices": ["Schwannoma", "Meningioma", "Astrocytoma", "Cavernous sinus hemangioma"], "answer": 1, "explanation": "B i.e. Meningioma Tumors or lesions (like infection, thrombosis, aneurysm, fistula) of cavernous sinus can cause neuropathy/involvment of 3rd, 4th 6th and 5th (V1 >>112.) cranial nerves because of their anatomical proximity to the lateral wall of cavernous sinus. So for pin pointing the diagnosis we have to focus on other features like sex, age, incidence and MR findings. Now lets focus on differential diagnosis of cavernous sinus masses which indicates that Schwannoma & meningioma are common; cavernous sinus hemangioma is very rare and astrocytoma is almost not a cause cavernous sinus masses. Unilateral Mass Common Uncommon - SchwannomaQ - Chordoma - MeningiomaQ - Lymphoma - Metastasis Very Rare - Aneurysm (cavernous- - Lipoma internal carotid aery) - Carotid cavernous - Epidermoid fistula - Cavernous hemangiome - Osteo cailagenous tumors - Plexiform neurofibroma (NF1) Bilateral Mass Common Uncommon - Invasive pituitary adenoma - Meningioma - Metastases - Lymphoma - Cavernous sinus thrombosis Lets focus on astrocytoma to see wheter it can be completely ruled out or not - Astrocytomas either do not/mildly enhance (low grade astrocytoma) or strongly enhance (anaplastic/malignant astrocytoma, glioblastoma multiformae, PA, PXA, SEGA) but when they enhance they characteristically enhance inhomogenously (heterogenously) mostlyQ (except in PXA >PA). Now we are left with cavernous hemangioma, meningioma and schwannoma Cavernous sinus hemangioma is a rare benign tumor seen in young or middle aged (4th & 5th decade) predominantly females (F:M = 9:1 to 3:1). It presents as homogenous hypointense on T1 and highly hyperintense on T2 weighted images. Contrast enhancement is homogenousQ, which distinguish them from other lesions. So it seems a probable answer but lets rule out other options. Trigeminal Schwannoma (neuroma) is a common cause of cavernous sinus mass. It presents predominantly in females (F:M=2:1) of 35 to 60 years ageQ. But it is characterized by high chances (3040%) of heterogeniety of both density and contrast enhancementQ (b/o tumor necrosis & cyst formation in larger > 1 mm tumors). So schwannoma can be easilyruled out. Meningiomas are common cause of cavernous sinus mass. It presents predominantly in females (F:M=4:1 to 2:1) of 35 to 70 years and even in younger patients in Wzv NF2Q. Meningiomas are characteristically homogenous hyperdense mass (with broad dural base) on CT and characteristically show homogenous (uniform) intense contrast enhancementQ. So this is the answer because it is far more common than CSH. Dont get confused that ----book mention, meningioma may be heterogenous without understanding the logic behind it. Brodly speaking any tumor may give any appearance but we are concerned about its typical / characteristic/ most common pattern of appearance. This and most of PGME question about CNS tumors are very broad concept based. Now let me rephrase this question to make it more clear : What would be your first diagnosis of cavernous sinus mass which appears hyper intense on T2 WI and shows homogenous contrast enhancement in a 20 yr old female.", "raw": {"question": "A 20 yr female come with a mass in the cavernous sinus & 6th cranial nerve palsy. In T2W MRI Hyperintense shadow is present which shows homogenous contrast enhancement. Diagnosis is:", "exp": "B i.e. Meningioma Tumors or lesions (like infection, thrombosis, aneurysm, fistula) of cavernous sinus can cause neuropathy/involvment of 3rd, 4th 6th and 5th (V1 >>112.) cranial nerves because of their anatomical proximity to the lateral wall of cavernous sinus. So for pin pointing the diagnosis we have to focus on other features like sex, age, incidence and MR findings. Now lets focus on differential diagnosis of cavernous sinus masses which indicates that Schwannoma & meningioma are common; cavernous sinus hemangioma is very rare and astrocytoma is almost not a cause cavernous sinus masses. Unilateral Mass Common Uncommon - SchwannomaQ - Chordoma - MeningiomaQ - Lymphoma - Metastasis Very Rare - Aneurysm (cavernous- - Lipoma internal carotid aery) - Carotid cavernous - Epidermoid fistula - Cavernous hemangiome - Osteo cailagenous tumors - Plexiform neurofibroma (NF1) Bilateral Mass Common Uncommon - Invasive pituitary adenoma - Meningioma - Metastases - Lymphoma - Cavernous sinus thrombosis Lets focus on astrocytoma to see wheter it can be completely ruled out or not - Astrocytomas either do not/mildly enhance (low grade astrocytoma) or strongly enhance (anaplastic/malignant astrocytoma, glioblastoma multiformae, PA, PXA, SEGA) but when they enhance they characteristically enhance inhomogenously (heterogenously) mostlyQ (except in PXA >PA). Now we are left with cavernous hemangioma, meningioma and schwannoma Cavernous sinus hemangioma is a rare benign tumor seen in young or middle aged (4th & 5th decade) predominantly females (F:M = 9:1 to 3:1). It presents as homogenous hypointense on T1 and highly hyperintense on T2 weighted images. Contrast enhancement is homogenousQ, which distinguish them from other lesions.

It is done by DNA polymerases. * DNA polymerases can synthesize a new strand only in 5'3' direction. Since they can synthesize a new strand complementary and antiparallel to the template strand, they want the template strand to be in 3'5' direction to synthesize a new strand continuously. * During replication, when the parent strand unwinds, there are two strands - one in 3'5' direction and the other one in 5'3' direction. * The 3'5' strand is treated as leading strand (as against a 3'5' strand, a 5'3' new strand can be synthesized continuously). 5'3' strand will be treated as lagging strand as against a 5'3; strand there is no DNA polymerase to synthesize a new strand in 3'5' direction. So across this 5'3' strand, the DNA polymerases synthesize from the angle of separation. * At the angle of separation, replication fork is formed. Replication fork is made up of Helicase (to cause unwinding of the two strands to enable replication to happen along the whole of DNA), RNA primase (to synthesis the RNA primer that is necessary for DNA polymerase to elongate the DNA strands), DNA polymerase d (to elongate the DNA strands) and single-stranded binding proteins (to prevent the two strands to reanneal). * First RNA primer synthesizes the RNA primer and then DNA polymerase a elongates the first 10 nucleotides of the DNA strand and then it is taken over by DNA polymerase d, which synthesizes 100 to 150 nucleotides. These short fragments with RNA primer attached to DNA fragments synthesized along lagging strand are called OKAZAKI FRAGMENTS.

Here it creates a flap at the 5' end of the RNA primer and that is removed by Flap endonuclease FEN1. * After the RNA primer is removed, DNA polymerase d fills the gap and DNA ligase unites the ends. * In prokaryotes, the process is almost the same, except that the enzymes are different.

Hence Okazaki fragments are synthesized by RNA primase and DNA polymerase III in prokaryotes. * DNA polymerase III synthesizes DNA fragments until it visualizes an RNA primer (synthesized by previous replication fork). DNA polymerase III recruits DNA polymerase I, which uses its 5*3* exonuclease activity to remove the RNA primer and DNA polymerase I fills the gap and DNA ligase unites the ends.

Skeletal muscle transpos NH3 to the Liver in the form of the amino acid 'alanine'. The alanine is formed in the muscle tissue by a transamination reaction between pyruvate (PA) and glutamate. 2. The alanine is transpoed through the bloodstream to the liver, where it reacts with a-ketoglutarate to reform Pyruvate and glutamate. This reaction is catalysed by alanine transaminase. 3. The nitrogen originating from the glutamate is processed by the urea cycle. 4. When the blood glucose is low, the Pyruvate resulting from alanine transamination is used to make glucose the gluconeogenesis pathway. 5. The glucose can be returned to the skeletal muscle to supply quick energy. Thus, the transpo of alanine from muscle to Liver results in a reciprocal transfer of glucose to muscle. The entire cyclical process is referred to as the \"glucose-alanine cycle\" (Fig. 27.5). Its impoance is propoional to the muscular activity of the organism.

A: Flea Plague is a zoonotic disease circulating mainly among small animals and their fleas. The bacteria Yersinia pestis can also infect humans. It is transmitted between animals and humans by the bite of infected fleas, direct contact, inhalation and rarely, ingestion of infective materials. Infected persons usually sta with \"flu-like\" symptoms after an incubation period of 3-7 days. Patients typically experience the sudden onset of fever, chills, head and body-aches and weakness, vomiting and nausea. Clinical plague infection manifests itself in three forms depending on the route of infection: bubonic, septicaemic and pneumonic. Bubonic form is the most common form of plague resulting from the bite of an infective flea. Plague bacillus enters the skin from the site of the bite and travels through the lymphatic system to the nearest lymph node. The lymph node then becomes inflamed because the plague bacteria, Yersinia pestis or Y. pestis, will replicate here in high numbers. The swollen lymph node is called a \"bubo\" which is very painful and can become suppurated as an open sore in advanced stage of infection; Septicaemic form of plague occurs when infection spreads directly through the bloodstream without evidence of a \"bubo\". More commonly advanced stages of bubonic plague will result in the presence of Y. pestis in the blood. Septicaemic plague may result from flea bites and from direct contact with infective materials through cracks in the skin. Pneumonic form of plague is the most virulent and least common form of plague. Typically, pneumonic form is due to a secondary spread from advanced infection of an initial bubonic form.

Veins respond at the lowest concentrations and aeries at slightly higher one (Veins express greater amount of the enzyme that generates NO )from organic nitrates). The primary direct result of an effective dose of nitroglycerine is marked relaxation of veins with increased venous capacitance and decreased ventricular preload. This leads to reduction in pulmonary vascular pressure and hea size. Effect of nitrates on coronary circulation '* In normal subjects without coronary disease - Nitroglycerine can induce a significant if transient increase in total coronary blood flow. In patients with angina due to atherosclerosis - There is no evidence that total coronary .flow is increased in patients with angina due to atherosclerotic obstructive coronary aery disease. However, in these patients - Nitrates cause redistribution of coronary blood flow from normal to ischemic regions which may play role in therapeutic effect. There are two types of vessels in coronary circulation :Larger conducting aeries They run epicardially and send perforating branches to deeper tissue. Smaller resistance vessels These are the perforating branches of larger conducting aeries. These aerioles supply blood to endocardium. If there is ischemia in any region of endocardium the perforating vessels of those region are dilated due to autoregulation (hypoxia causes vasodilation). Nitrates preferentially dilates larger conducting vessels. This pattern of action ours more blood flow towards the ischaemic zone as the smaller endocardial vessels are already dilated as a result of hypoxia / ischaemia. Nitrates in hea failure Nitrates afford relief by causing venous pooling of blood. - Nitrates reduce venous return (preload) decreases end diastolic volume -4 improvement in left ventricular function by Laplace law regression of pulmonary congestion. Nitrates are used in cyanide poisoning Cyanide poisoning results from complexing of cytochrome iron by the CV ion. - Methemoglobin has a very affinity for CN ion. - Methemoglobin combines with CN to form cyamnethemoglobin which is rapidly excreted by the body. It is a well known fact that Nitrates generate generate Methemoglobin when they combine with Hb. - Thus administration of nitrates will generate large amount of methemoglobin. - Due to its high offinity.for cyanide, methemoglobin combines with cyanide .forming cyanmethemoglobin. - This will regenerate active cytochrome. - However this may again dissociate to release cyanide. - The cynamethemoglobin can be fuher detoxified by the intravenous administration of sodium thiosulfate. This results in formation of thiocyanate ion a less toxic ion that is readily excreted. Biliary colic Esophageal spasm Sublingual GIN promptly relieves pain. Nitrates taken before a meal facilitate feeding in esophageal achalasia by reducing esophageal tone. Also remember these impoant propeies of Nitrates. Oral availability of Nitrates is low The liver contains a high capacity organic nitrate reductase that removes nitrate groups in a stepwise _fashion from the parent molecule and ultimately inactivates the drug. Therefore oral bioavailability of the traditional organic nitrates e.g. nitroglycerine and isosorbidedinitrate is very low. For this reason sublingual route is preferred for nitrates. Nitroglycerine and isosorbide dintrate are both absorbed effectively by this route and reach therapeutic blood levels within a few minutes. Nitrates develop tolerance With continued exposure smooth muscles develop tolerance to nitrates. The mechanism by which tolerance develops are not completely understood.

{"id": 98164, "question": "Hypokalamia is associated with ?", "choices": ["Alkalosis", "Periodic paralysis", "Type 1 A", "Organophosphate poisoining"], "answer": 3, "explanation": "Pathophysiology Hypokalaemia is generally indicative of abnormal potassium loss from the body, through either the kidney or the gastrointestinal tract. Renal causes of hypokalaemia can be divided into those with and those without hypeension. Hypokalaemia in the presence of hypeension may be due to increased aldosterone secretion in Conn's syndrome (p. 674) or a genetic defect affecting sodium channels in the distal nephron (Liddle's syndrome). Excessive intake of liquorice or treatment with carbenoxolone may result in a similar clinical picture, due to inhibition of the renal 11bHSD2 enzyme, which inactivates coisol in peripheral tissues. associated with organophospharus poisoning If blood pressure is normal or low, hypokalaemia can be classified according to the associated change in acid-base balance. Inherited defects in tubular transpo should be suspected when hypokalaemia occurs in association with alkalosis, provided that diuretic use has been excluded. One such disease is Bater's syndrome, in which sodium reabsorption in the thick ascending limb of Henle is defective, usually due to a loss-of-function mutation of the NKCC2 transpoer. The clinical and biochemical features are similar to those in chronic treatment with furosemide. In Gitelman's syndrome there is a loss-of-function mutation affecting the NCCT transpoer in the early distal tubule. The clinical and biochemical features are similar to chronic thiazide treatment. Note that while both Bater's and Gitelman's syndromes are characterised by hypokalaemia and hypomagnesaemia, urinary calcium excretion is increased in Bater's syndrome but decreased in Gitelman's syndrome, analogous to the effects of the loop and thiazide diuretics, respectively, on calcium transpo (see Box 14.9). If hypokalaemia occurs in the presence of a normal blood pressure and metabolic acidosis, renal tubular acidosis (proximal or 'classical' distal) should be suspected (p. 364). When hypokalaemia is due to potassium wasting through the gastrointestinal tract, the cause is usually obvious clinically. In some cases, when there is occult induction of vomiting, the hypokalaemia is characteristically associated with metabolic alkalosis, due to loss of gastric acid. If, however, potassium loss has occurred through the surreptitious use of aperients, the hypokalaemia is generally associated with metabolic acidosis. In both cases, urinary potassium excretion is low unless there is significant extracellular volume depletion, which can raise urinary potassium levels by stimulating aldosterone production. Hypokalaemia can also be caused by redistribution of potassium into cells as the result of insulin, b-adrenoceptor agonists and alkalosis, or as the result of K+ flux into muscle in hypokalaemic periodic paralysis, which is associated with mutations in several genes that regulate transmembrane ion flow into muscle cells. Finally, reduced dietary intake of potassium can contribute to hypokalaemia but is seldom the only cause, except in extreme cases.

For example, denying that the physicians's diagnosis of cancer is correct and seeking a second opinion.2) Repression and suppression:- Repression acts unconsciously to exclude anxiety provoking ideas or feelings from conscious awareness. For example, a person who has repressed memories of abuse suffered as a child. When this is done consciously by forcing the unwanted information out of our awareness, it is referred as suppression, i.e., pushing the unwanted feelings into unconscious. For example, trying to forget something that causes anxiety. Suppression is the only voluntary defence mechanism.o Unconscious exclusion of anxiety provoking feelings from awareness - Repressiono Conscious exclusion of anxiety provoking feelings from awareness - Suppressiono Repression is the most basic defence mechanism therefore it is also referred as primary defence.3) Displacement:- Unconscious shifting of impulses on a less threatening target. For example, rather than express our anger in way's that could lead to negative consequences (like arguing with our boss), we instead express our anger towards a person or object that poses no threat (such as our spouse, children or pets).4) Sublimation:- Acting out unacceptabe impulses in a socially acceptable way. For example, sublimating your aggressive impulses toward a carrier as a boxer, or becoming a surgeon because of your desire to cut or lifting weight to release 'pent up' energy.5) Projection:- Placing unacceptable impulses in ourself onto someone else. In very simple language, Projection is placing blame for the unwanted event upon other. For example, would be saying that you failed in exam because the teacher is racist.6) Intellectualization:- Excessive use of intellectual processes (logic) to avoid affective expression (emotion), i.e., avoiding unacceptable emotions by focusing on the intellectual aspects. For example, a person who has just been diagnosed with a terminal illness might focus on learning everything about the disease in order to avoid distress and remain distant from the reality of the situation.7) Rationalization:- It is a defense mechanism that involves offering a socially acceptable behavior or feeling. For example, a student might blame a poor exam score on the instructor rather than his/her lack of preparation.8) Regression:- The personality may suffer a loss of some of the development already attained and may revert to a lower level of adaptation and expression. When confronted by stressful events, people sometimes abandon coping strategies and revert to patterns of behaviour used earlier in development.

These initial changes typically occur in the mucosal lymphoid tissue. In more active disease (As the inflammatoy process worsens), aphthous lesions tend to coalesce and deepen, forming stellate or bear-claw-shaped ulcers. With progression of disease, stellate ulcerations fuse longitudinally and transversely outlining areas of uninvolved mucosa give rise to a cobblestone appearance (demarcate islands of mucosa that frequently are histologically normal). This &;cobblestone&; appearance is characteristic of CD, both endoscopically and by barium radiography. With progression of disease the disease eventually becomes transmural: Serosal and mesenteric inflammatory promotes adhesions and fistula formation. The bowel wall thickens and becomes narrowed and fibrotic, leading to chronic, recurrent bowel obstructions. Projections of the thickened mesentery encase the bowel (\"creeping fat\") Although Pseudohyperophy are typical of Ulcerative colitis, they may also be seen in Crohn&;s disease: Inflammatory Pseudohyperophy representing isolated islands of regenerating mucosa can also form in CD (as in UC).

{"id": 128388, "question": "Meissner's corpuscle is for-", "choices": ["Touch", "Temperature", "Pressure", "Proprioception"], "answer": 0, "explanation": "Ans. A. TouchCUTANEOUS MECHANORECEPTORS: -Sensory receptors can be specialized dendritic endings of afferent nerve fibers, and they are often associated with non- neural cells that surround them forming a sense organ. Touch and pressure are sensed by four types of mechanoreceptors.a. Meissner corpuscles are dendrites encapsulated in connective tissue and respond to changes in texture and slow vibrations.b. Merkel cells are expanded dendritic endings, and they respond to sustained pressure and touch.c. Ruffini corpuscles are enlarged dendritic endings with elongated capsules, and they respond to sustained pressure.d. Pacinian corpuscles consist of unmyelinated dendritic endings of a sensory nerve fiber, 2 um in diameter, encapsulated by concentric lamellae of connective tissue that give the organ the appearance of a cocktail onion. These receptors respond to deep pressure and fast vibration.e. The sensory nerves from these mechanoreceptors are large myelinated Aa and Ab fibers whose conduction velocities range from ~ 70-120 to ~ 40-75 m/s, respectively.a. Sensory systems encode four elementary attributes of stimuli: modality, location (receptive field), intensity, and duration (timing).b. The human hand has four types of mechanoreceptors; their combined activation produces the sensation of contact with an object. Selective activation of Merkel cells and Ruffini endings causes sensation of steady pressure; selective activation of Meissner and Pacinian corpuscles causes tingling and vibratory sensation.c.

TouchCUTANEOUS MECHANORECEPTORS: -Sensory receptors can be specialized dendritic endings of afferent nerve fibers, and they are often associated with non- neural cells that surround them forming a sense organ. Touch and pressure are sensed by four types of mechanoreceptors.a. Meissner corpuscles are dendrites encapsulated in connective tissue and respond to changes in texture and slow vibrations.b. Merkel cells are expanded dendritic endings, and they respond to sustained pressure and touch.c. Ruffini corpuscles are enlarged dendritic endings with elongated capsules, and they respond to sustained pressure.d. Pacinian corpuscles consist of unmyelinated dendritic endings of a sensory nerve fiber, 2 um in diameter, encapsulated by concentric lamellae of connective tissue that give the organ the appearance of a cocktail onion. These receptors respond to deep pressure and fast vibration.e. The sensory nerves from these mechanoreceptors are large myelinated Aa and Ab fibers whose conduction velocities range from ~ 70-120 to ~ 40-75 m/s, respectively.a. Sensory systems encode four elementary attributes of stimuli: modality, location (receptive field), intensity, and duration (timing).b. The human hand has four types of mechanoreceptors; their combined activation produces the sensation of contact with an object. Selective activation of Merkel cells and Ruffini endings causes sensation of steady pressure; selective activation of Meissner and Pacinian corpuscles causes tingling and vibratory sensation.c.

The presence of a stable ETCO2 for three successive breaths indicates that the tube is not in the esophagus.

For example, the tip of the tube could be located in a main-stem bronchus. Capnography is also a monitor of potential changes in perfusion or dead space, is a very sensitive indicator of anesthetic circuit disconnects and gas circuit leaks, and is a method to detect the quality of CO2 absorption\".Endotracheal intubation or laryngeal mask airway insertion requires qualitative identification of carbon dioxide in the expired gas. During general anesthesia, capnography and end-tidal carbon dioxide analysis are encouraged. Capnometry is the measurement and numeric representation of the C02 concentration during inspiration and expiration. A capnogram is a continuous concentration-time display of the C02 concentration sampled at a patient's airway during ventilation.Capnography# is the continuous monitoring of a patient's capnogram.# The capnogram is divided into four distinct phases (Fi. The first phase (A-B) represents the initial stage of expiration. Gas sampled during this phase occupies the anatomic dead space and is normally devoid of CO2. At point B, CO2- containing gas presents itself at the sampling site, and a sharp upstroke (B-C) is seen in the capnogram. The slope of this upstroke is determined by the evenness of ventilation and alveolar emptying. Phase C-D represents the alveolar or expiratory plateau. At this phase of the capnogram, alveolar gas is being sampled. Normally, this part of the waveform is almost horizontal. Point D is the highest CO2 value and is called the end-tidal CO2 (ETCO2). ETCO2 is the best reflection of the alveolar CO2 (PACO2). As the patient begins to inspire, fresh gas is entrained and there is a steep downstroke (D-E) back to baseline. Unless rebreathing of CO2 occurs, the baseline approaches zero.# The utility of capnography depends on an understanding of the relationship between arterial CO2 (PaCO2), alveolar CO2 (PACO2), and ETCO2. If the PaCO2-PACO2 gradient is constant and small, capnography provides a noninvasive, continuous, real-time reflection of ventilation. During general anesthesia, the ETC02-PaC02 gradient typically is 5 to 10 mm Hg.# Maldistribution is a common cause of an increased PaCO2-PACO2 gradient. Other patient factors that may influence the accuracy of ETCO2 monitoring by widening the PaCO2-ETCO2 gradient include shallow tidal breaths, prolongation of the expiratory phase of ventilation, or uneven alveolar emptying.# Increases in ETCO2 can be expected when CO2 production exceeds ventilation, such as in hyperthermia or when an exogenous source of CO2 is present# A sudden drop in ETCO2 to near zero followed by the absence of a CO2 waveform is a potentially life-threatening problem that could indicate malposition of an endotracheal tube into the pharynx or esophagus, sudden severe hypotension, pulmonary embolism, a cardiac arrest, or an artifact resulting from disruption of sampling lines. During life-saving cardiopulmonary resuscitation, the generation of adequate perfusion can be assessed by the restoration of the CO2 waveform.# Whereas abrupt decreases in the ETCO2 are often associated with an altered cardiopulmonary status (e.g., embolism or hypoperfusion), gradual reductions in ETCO2 more often reflect decreases in PaCO2 that occur after increases in minute ventilation where ventilation overmatches CO2 production.# Several methods for the quantification of CO2 have been applied to patient monitoring systems. One of the most commonly used methods is based on infrared absorption spectrophotometry (IRAS).Additional Educational points:# ETCO2 is the best reflection of the alveolar CO2 tension.# Increase in ETCO2 is the most sensitive early sign of malignant hyperthermia.6Most Sensitsive|||||Transesophageal echocardiographyPrecordial DopplerPulmonary artery catheter (| PAP)Capnography (|ETCO2)Mass spectrometry (| ETN2 most specific and quantitative)Least SensitivePAP= pulmonary artery pressure; ETCO2= end-tidal carbon dioxide; ETN2=end-tidal nitrogen.", "raw": {"question": "Capnography is useful for:", "exp": "Ans.

The slope of this upstroke is determined by the evenness of ventilation and alveolar emptying. Phase C-D represents the alveolar or expiratory plateau. At this phase of the capnogram, alveolar gas is being sampled. Normally, this part of the waveform is almost horizontal. Point D is the highest CO2 value and is called the end-tidal CO2 (ETCO2). ETCO2 is the best reflection of the alveolar CO2 (PACO2). As the patient begins to inspire, fresh gas is entrained and there is a steep downstroke (D-E) back to baseline. Unless rebreathing of CO2 occurs, the baseline approaches zero.# The utility of capnography depends on an understanding of the relationship between arterial CO2 (PaCO2), alveolar CO2 (PACO2), and ETCO2. If the PaCO2-PACO2 gradient is constant and small, capnography provides a noninvasive, continuous, real-time reflection of ventilation. During general anesthesia, the ETC02-PaC02 gradient typically is 5 to 10 mm Hg.# Maldistribution is a common cause of an increased PaCO2-PACO2 gradient. Other patient factors that may influence the accuracy of ETCO2 monitoring by widening the PaCO2-ETCO2 gradient include shallow tidal breaths, prolongation of the expiratory phase of ventilation, or uneven alveolar emptying.# Increases in ETCO2 can be expected when CO2 production exceeds ventilation, such as in hyperthermia or when an exogenous source of CO2 is present# A sudden drop in ETCO2 to near zero followed by the absence of a CO2 waveform is a potentially life-threatening problem that could indicate malposition of an endotracheal tube into the pharynx or esophagus, sudden severe hypotension, pulmonary embolism, a cardiac arrest, or an artifact resulting from disruption of sampling lines. During life-saving cardiopulmonary resuscitation, the generation of adequate perfusion can be assessed by the restoration of the CO2 waveform.# Whereas abrupt decreases in the ETCO2 are often associated with an altered cardiopulmonary status (e.g., embolism or hypoperfusion), gradual reductions in ETCO2 more often reflect decreases in PaCO2 that occur after increases in minute ventilation where ventilation overmatches CO2 production.# Several methods for the quantification of CO2 have been applied to patient monitoring systems. One of the most commonly used methods is based on infrared absorption spectrophotometry (IRAS).Additional Educational points:# ETCO2 is the best reflection of the alveolar CO2 tension.# Increase in ETCO2 is the most sensitive early sign of malignant hyperthermia.6Most Sensitsive|||||Transesophageal echocardiographyPrecordial DopplerPulmonary artery catheter (| PAP)Capnography (|ETCO2)Mass spectrometry (| ETN2 most specific and quantitative)Least SensitivePAP= pulmonary artery pressure; ETCO2= end-tidal carbon dioxide; ETN2=end-tidal nitrogen.", "cop": 3, "opa": "determining Vaporizer malfunction or contamination", "opb": "determining circuit hypoxia", "opc": "determining the appropriate placement of endotracheal tube.", "opd": "detetcing concentration of oxygen in the anesthetic circuit", "subject_name": "Anaesthesia", "topic_name": "Anaesthetic Equipments", "id": "2af5c270-1b5b-47a5-95bc-b70c2a7ae595", "choice_type": "single"}, "correct": false, "pred": 1, "probs": [0.11382295191287994, 0.5101190805435181, 0.19976550340652466, 0.17629244923591614], "golden_prob": 0.19976550340652466, "pred_prob": 0.5101190805435181, "output": 2}

{"id": 45887, "question": "Which drug is not used to prevent contrastnephropathy aEUR'", "choices": ["Fenoldopam", "N-acetylcysteine", "Infusion of Hair normal saline", "Hemodialysis"], "answer": 0, "explanation": "Fenoldopam The administration of radiocontrast media can lead to a usually reversible form of acute kidney injury (formerly called acute renal failure) that begins soon after the contrast is administered. In most cases, there are no permanent sequelae, but there is some evidence that its development is associated with adverse outcomes. Prevention There is no specific treatment once contrast-induced acute renal failure develops, and management must be as ,for any cause of acute tubular necrosis, with the focus on maintaining fluid and electrolyte balance. The best treatment of contrast-induced renal failure is prevention. A variety of preventive measures may reduce the risk of contras nephropathv. Types of radiocontrast agents Iodinated radiocontrast agents are either ionic or nonionic and, at the concentrations required for aeriography or computed tomography, are of variable osmolality: First generation agents are ionic monomers; they are highly hyperosmolal (approximately 1400 to 1800 mosmol/kg) compared with the osmolality of plasma. Second generation agents, such as iohexol, are nonionic monomers with a lower osmolality than the first generation radiocontrast media. - The newest nonionic contrast agents are isoosmolal. These isoosmolal agents have a lower osmolality than \"low osniolal\" second generation drugs. The iso-osnzolal nonionic contrast agent iodixanol appears to reduce the risk of contrast nephropathy in high-risk patients, such as diabetic patients with renal insufficiency, compared to the low osmolal nonionic agent iohexol, but not when compared to other low osnzolal nonionic agents. -However, additional randomized prospective trials comparing iodixanol (or other iso-osmolal agents if developed) to other low osmolal ionic or nonionic agents are required before it can be determined that isoosmolal contrast agents are uniformly less nephrotoxic than low osmolal agents as a class, especially given the substantially greater expense of the only currently available iso-osmolal nonionic agent, iodixanol. Hydration, mantilla, and diuretics Hydration is beneficial, and the type of hydration solution may be impoant. In comparison, the role of diuretics, mannitol and other renal vasodilators in this setting is unceain. Diuretics Several small trials have investigated the effect of diuretics. In one trial, 78 patients with stable chronic renal failure (mean plasma creatinine concentration 2.1 ing/dL or >25 percent, measured 2 to 5 days after the procedure) occurred less frequently among patients who received iloprost compared to placebo (8 versus 22 percent respectively). - Severe hypotension required withdrawal of Iloprost in three patients. Although Iloprost may be effective in the prevention of contrast nephropathy, confirmation of these results in larger definitive trials is necessary before its use can be recommended. Fetzoldopanz - A prospective randomized trial (CONTRAST) assessed the effectiveness of fenoldopam in 315 patients (one-half diabetic) undergoing a cardiovascular procedure who had chronic renal .failure with an estimated creatinine clearance below 60 mllmin (mean 29 m1/min with a mean serum creatinine of 1.8 mg/dL ). - All patients also received one-half normal saline as mentioned above, and contrast nephropathy was defined as an increase in serum creatinine of ?..25 percent above baseline in the first four days. - There was no reduction in the incidence of contrast nephropathy in the fenoldopam group (34 versus 30 percent with placebo). It has been proposed that direct intrarenal administration may be more beneficial. Endothelia: receptor antagonist - A nonselective endothelin receptor antagonist was tested in a multicenter, double-blind randomized trial of high-risk patients undergoing coronary angiography. Compared with those assigned to placebo, a significantly higher percentage of patients who received active therapy sustained contrast nephropathy (56 versus 29 percent); this observation raises the possibility that endothelin may actually provide an intrinsic protective effect rather than contributing to the development of acute renal failure. Alternatively, selective endothelin receptor antagonists may be required to demonstrate prophylactic value in this setting. Summary And Recommendations Optimal therapy to prevent contrast-induced acute renal failure remains unceain. Patients with near-normal renal function are at little risk and,few precautions are necessary other than avoidance of volume depletion. We recommend the following preventive measures for patients at increased risk of contrast nephropathy, which is defined a serum creatinine 1.5 mg/d1. (132 tnicromol/L) or an estimated glomerular filtration rate <60 ml/1.73 m2, Use, if -possible, ultrasonography, MRI without gadolinium contrast, or CT scanning without radiocontrast agents. We recommend NOT using high osmolul agents. We recommend the use of iodixanol or nonionic low osmolal agents such as iopamidol or ioversol rather than iohexol. Use lower doses of contrast and avoid repetitive, closely spaced studies. Avoid volume depletion and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. If there are no contraindications to volume expansion, we recommend isotonic intravenous fluids prior to and continued for several hours after contrast administration. The optimal type of fluid and timing of administration are not well established. We suggest isotonic bicarbonate rather than isotonic saline. Despite conflicting data, we suggest that acetylcysteine be administered the day before and the day of the procedure, based upon its potential .for benefit and low toxicity and cost. If acetylcysteine is administered, we suggest giving 1200 mg orally twice daily rather than 600 mg twice daily the day before and the day of the procedure. Based upon the lack of convincing evidence of benefit and the potential risk of anaphylactoid reactions, we suggest not using intravenous acetylcysteine for the prevention of contrast nephropathy.

Among patients with stage 5 CKD, we suggest prophylactic hemodialysis after contrast exposure if there is already a .functioning hemodialysis access.", "raw": {"question": "Which drug is not used to prevent contrastnephropathy aEUR'", "exp": "Fenoldopam The administration of radiocontrast media can lead to a usually reversible form of acute kidney injury (formerly called acute renal failure) that begins soon after the contrast is administered. In most cases, there are no permanent sequelae, but there is some evidence that its development is associated with adverse outcomes. Prevention There is no specific treatment once contrast-induced acute renal failure develops, and management must be as ,for any cause of acute tubular necrosis, with the focus on maintaining fluid and electrolyte balance. The best treatment of contrast-induced renal failure is prevention. A variety of preventive measures may reduce the risk of contras nephropathv. Types of radiocontrast agents Iodinated radiocontrast agents are either ionic or nonionic and, at the concentrations required for aeriography or computed tomography, are of variable osmolality: First generation agents are ionic monomers; they are highly hyperosmolal (approximately 1400 to 1800 mosmol/kg) compared with the osmolality of plasma. Second generation agents, such as iohexol, are nonionic monomers with a lower osmolality than the first generation radiocontrast media. - The newest nonionic contrast agents are isoosmolal. These isoosmolal agents have a lower osmolality than \"low osniolal\" second generation drugs. The iso-osnzolal nonionic contrast agent iodixanol appears to reduce the risk of contrast nephropathy in high-risk patients, such as diabetic patients with renal insufficiency, compared to the low osmolal nonionic agent iohexol, but not when compared to other low osnzolal nonionic agents. -However, additional randomized prospective trials comparing iodixanol (or other iso-osmolal agents if developed) to other low osmolal ionic or nonionic agents are required before it can be determined that isoosmolal contrast agents are uniformly less nephrotoxic than low osmolal agents as a class, especially given the substantially greater expense of the only currently available iso-osmolal nonionic agent, iodixanol. Hydration, mantilla, and diuretics Hydration is beneficial, and the type of hydration solution may be impoant. In comparison, the role of diuretics, mannitol and other renal vasodilators in this setting is unceain. Diuretics Several small trials have investigated the effect of diuretics. In one trial, 78 patients with stable chronic renal failure (mean plasma creatinine concentration 2.1 ing/dL or >25 percent, measured 2 to 5 days after the procedure) occurred less frequently among patients who received iloprost compared to placebo (8 versus 22 percent respectively). - Severe hypotension required withdrawal of Iloprost in three patients. Although Iloprost may be effective in the prevention of contrast nephropathy, confirmation of these results in larger definitive trials is necessary before its use can be recommended. Fetzoldopanz - A prospective randomized trial (CONTRAST) assessed the effectiveness of fenoldopam in 315 patients (one-half diabetic) undergoing a cardiovascular procedure who had chronic renal .failure with an estimated creatinine clearance below 60 mllmin (mean 29 m1/min with a mean serum creatinine of 1.8 mg/dL ). - All patients also received one-half normal saline as mentioned above, and contrast nephropathy was defined as an increase in serum creatinine of ?..25 percent above baseline in the first four days. - There was no reduction in the incidence of contrast nephropathy in the fenoldopam group (34 versus 30 percent with placebo). It has been proposed that direct intrarenal administration may be more beneficial. Endothelia: receptor antagonist - A nonselective endothelin receptor antagonist was tested in a multicenter, double-blind randomized trial of high-risk patients undergoing coronary angiography. Compared with those assigned to placebo, a significantly higher percentage of patients who received active therapy sustained contrast nephropathy (56 versus 29 percent); this observation raises the possibility that endothelin may actually provide an intrinsic protective effect rather than contributing to the development of acute renal failure. Alternatively, selective endothelin receptor antagonists may be required to demonstrate prophylactic value in this setting. Summary And Recommendations Optimal therapy to prevent contrast-induced acute renal failure remains unceain. Patients with near-normal renal function are at little risk and,few precautions are necessary other than avoidance of volume depletion. We recommend the following preventive measures for patients at increased risk of contrast nephropathy, which is defined a serum creatinine 1.5 mg/d1. (132 tnicromol/L) or an estimated glomerular filtration rate <60 ml/1.73 m2, Use, if -possible, ultrasonography, MRI without gadolinium contrast, or CT scanning without radiocontrast agents. We recommend NOT using high osmolul agents. We recommend the use of iodixanol or nonionic low osmolal agents such as iopamidol or ioversol rather than iohexol. Use lower doses of contrast and avoid repetitive, closely spaced studies. Avoid volume depletion and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. If there are no contraindications to volume expansion, we recommend isotonic intravenous fluids prior to and continued for several hours after contrast administration. The optimal type of fluid and timing of administration are not well established. We suggest isotonic bicarbonate rather than isotonic saline. Despite conflicting data, we suggest that acetylcysteine be administered the day before and the day of the procedure, based upon its potential .for benefit and low toxicity and cost. If acetylcysteine is administered, we suggest giving 1200 mg orally twice daily rather than 600 mg twice daily the day before and the day of the procedure. Based upon the lack of convincing evidence of benefit and the potential risk of anaphylactoid reactions, we suggest not using intravenous acetylcysteine for the prevention of contrast nephropathy. (Note: Oral acetylcysteine is used.) We recommend NOT using mannitol or other diuretics prophylactically. Among patients with stage 3 and 4 CKD, we recommend NOT performing prophylactic hemofiltration or hemodialysis after contrast exposure. Among patients with stage 5 CKD, we suggest prophylactic hemodialysis after contrast exposure if there is already a .functioning hemodialysis access.", "cop": 1, "opa": "Fenoldopam", "opb": "N-acetylcysteine", "opc": "Infusion of Hair normal saline", "opd": "Hemodialysis", "subject_name": "Surgery", "topic_name": null, "id": "f1cc9823-1b99-4200-8206-3f4e77504ae8", "choice_type": "single"}, "correct": false, "pred": 3, "probs": [0.22574135661125183, 0.12862354516983032, 0.1369190514087677, 0.5087159872055054], "golden_prob": 0.22574135661125183, "pred_prob": 0.5087159872055054, "output": 0}

When the apo-B-100 binds to the apo-B-100 receptor, the receptor-LDL complex is internalised by endocytosis. The endosome vesicle thus formed fuses with lysosomes. The receptor is recycled and returns to the cell surface. The LDL paicle, along with apoproteins and cholesterol ester is hydrolyzed by lysosomal hydrolases, forming amino acids and free cholesterol. The free receptors can now return to the membrane surface to bind fuher LDL molecules (Fig. 12.13). Approximately 70% of LDL is degraded in the liver, and the rest in extra-hepatic tissues. For their work on LDL receptors, Michael Brown and Joseph Goldstein were awarded Nobel prize in 1985. Function of LDL About 75% of the plasma cholesterol is incorporated into the LDL paicles. LDL transpos cholesterol from liver to the peripheral tissues. The cholesterol thus liberated in the cell has three major fates:It is used for the synthesis of other steroids like steroid hormones.Cholesterol may be incorporated into the membranes.Cholesterol may be esterified to a MUFA by acyl cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) for storage.

It's advantages are that it is potent, induction is smooth, pleasant to inhale, the vapor is not irritant to the skin and mucous membranes and does not produce necrosis when split on tissues. It suppresses salivary, mucous, bronchial, and gastric secretions and dilates the bronchioles.- IndicationsInduction but more often for the maintenance of general anaesthesia.- Specific considerationsHalothane reduces muscle tone in pregnant uterus and generally its use is not recommended in obstetrics because of the increased risk of postpartum hemorrhage.- Halothane should not be used for patients with cardiac arrhythmias.- Halothane was considered to be unsafe in patients with acute porphyria.# Adverse Effects- Cardiovascular: Halothane has a depressant action on the cardiovascular systemand reduces blood pressure; signs of overdosage are bradycardia and profound hypotension. It is also a respiratory depressant and can cause cardiac arrhythmias; there have been instances of cardiac arrest. The sensitivity of the heart to sympathomimetic amines is increased.- Hepatic: dysfunction, hepatitis, and necrosis have been reported following the use of halothane, more frequent following repeated use. Serious hepatotoxicity has limited its use in recent years.- Other: malignant hyperpyrexia, involuntary muscle movements, hiccup, coughing, bronchospasm, laryngospasm and respiratory depression.# Drug interactions1.

For induction in children a concentration of 1.5 to 2% v/v has been used.. The more usual practice is to induce anaesthesia with an intravenous agent.

Reduce maintenance dose in obstetric anaesthesia.Breastfeeding: No data.# Adverse effectsCommon: On induction, coughing, breath-holding, laryngospasm.# DosageInduction: 1.5-3% inspired concentration in oxygen and nitrous oxide produces surgical anaesthesia within 10 minutes; alternatively, start at an inspired concentration of 0.5% and increase gradually to the required level.# Maintenance: 0.5-2.5% inspired concentration in oxygen and nitrous oxide; 1.5-3.5% inspired concentration when used with oxygen alone.NITROUS OXIDEIntroduction:# in anaesthesia, it is mainly used as an adjunct to other inhalational anaesthetics, allowing them to be used at lower concentrations# it is a weak anaesthetic but has strong analgesic properties; used in subanaesthetic concentrations in obstetrics, emergency care and procedures not requiring loss of consciousness; premixed nitrous oxide 50% and oxygen 50% alone is suitable for self-administration# prolonged inhalation can inactivate vitamin B12 and interfere with DNA synthesis causing haematological and neuro- logical adverse effects; avoid exposures of >6 hours# whether or not chronic low level occupational exposure is harmful to staff remains unresolved; control nitrous oxide pollution using a scavenging system and effective ventilation# protect cylinders containing 50% nitrous oxide and 50% oxygen from the cold; if cooled to temperatures < -7degC, liquid nitrous oxide separates and may require remixing before use# Mode of actionNitrous oxide is an anesthetic administred by inhalation. It is a weak anaesthetic with minimum alveolar concentration value of 110%. It has strong analgesic properties, but produces little muscle relaxation.# IndicationsNitrous oxide is used as an adjuvant to other anaesthetics and permits them to be used at a significantly reduced dosage. It is given with oxygen for anaesthesia especially in obstetrics. Recovery is usually rapid from nitrous oxide anaesthesia.# Specific considerationsAir-containing cavities (e.g. middle ear occlusion, abdominal distension, pneumothorax, air embolus), or during or after pneumoencephalography or vitreoretinal surgery involving gases such as sulphur hexafluoride: risk of increased pressure and/or volume within such cavities.Vitamin B12 deficiency: increased risk of neurological dysfunction, including subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord with prolonged exposure.Pregnancy: Safe to use; ADEC category A.# Adverse effectsThe main complications are those due to varying degrees of hypoxia..Rare: With prolonged (eg >24 hours) or repeated use: megaloblastic anaemia, leucopenia, agranulocytosis, neuropathy, myeloneuropathy.DosageInduction: 70% with 30% oxygen, (in combination with other anaesthetic agent).Maintenance: 30-70% with oxygen, (in combination with other anaesthetic agent).Analgesia: 25-50% with oxygen.", "raw": {"question": "Which of the following is a pleasant anaesthetic agent preferred for inhalation mask anaesthesia in children?", "exp": "Ans.

Anaesthesia is maintained with concentrations of 0.5 to 2% v/v depending on the flow rate used; the lower concentration is usually suitable for the elderly.ISOFLURANE# Mode of actionThought to enhance inhibitory ion channel activity and inhibit excitatory activity in the brain to induce hypnosis and amnesia, and in the spinal cord to cause immobility in response to painful stimuli.# IndicationsInduction and maintenance of general anaesthesia.# ContraindicationsSpecific considerationsPregnancy: Limited data; ADEC category B3. Reduce maintenance dose in obstetric anaesthesia.Breastfeeding: No data.# Adverse effectsCommon: On induction, coughing, breath-holding, laryngospasm.# DosageInduction: 1.5-3% inspired concentration in oxygen and nitrous oxide produces surgical anaesthesia within 10 minutes; alternatively, start at an inspired concentration of 0.5% and increase gradually to the required level.# Maintenance: 0.5-2.5% inspired concentration in oxygen and nitrous oxide; 1.5-3.5% inspired concentration when used with oxygen alone.NITROUS OXIDEIntroduction:# in anaesthesia, it is mainly used as an adjunct to other inhalational anaesthetics, allowing them to be used at lower concentrations# it is a weak anaesthetic but has strong analgesic properties; used in subanaesthetic concentrations in obstetrics, emergency care and procedures not requiring loss of consciousness; premixed nitrous oxide 50% and oxygen 50% alone is suitable for self-administration# prolonged inhalation can inactivate vitamin B12 and interfere with DNA synthesis causing haematological and neuro- logical adverse effects; avoid exposures of >6 hours# whether or not chronic low level occupational exposure is harmful to staff remains unresolved; control nitrous oxide pollution using a scavenging system and effective ventilation# protect cylinders containing 50% nitrous oxide and 50% oxygen from the cold; if cooled to temperatures < -7degC, liquid nitrous oxide separates and may require remixing before use# Mode of actionNitrous oxide is an anesthetic administred by inhalation. It is a weak anaesthetic with minimum alveolar concentration value of 110%. It has strong analgesic properties, but produces little muscle relaxation.# IndicationsNitrous oxide is used as an adjuvant to other anaesthetics and permits them to be used at a significantly reduced dosage. It is given with oxygen for anaesthesia especially in obstetrics. Recovery is usually rapid from nitrous oxide anaesthesia.# Specific considerationsAir-containing cavities (e.g. middle ear occlusion, abdominal distension, pneumothorax, air embolus), or during or after pneumoencephalography or vitreoretinal surgery involving gases such as sulphur hexafluoride: risk of increased pressure and/or volume within such cavities.Vitamin B12 deficiency: increased risk of neurological dysfunction, including subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord with prolonged exposure.Pregnancy: Safe to use; ADEC category A.# Adverse effectsThe main complications are those due to varying degrees of hypoxia..Rare: With prolonged (eg >24 hours) or repeated use: megaloblastic anaemia, leucopenia, agranulocytosis, neuropathy, myeloneuropathy.DosageInduction: 70% with 30% oxygen, (in combination with other anaesthetic agent).Maintenance: 30-70% with oxygen, (in combination with other anaesthetic agent).Analgesia: 25-50% with oxygen.", "cop": 1, "opa": "Sevolfurane", "opb": "Desflurane", "opc": "isoflurane", "opd": "Enflurane", "subject_name": "Anaesthesia", "topic_name": "General Anesthesia", "id": "b9c3dc38-29dc-4cd9-b8e8-5d06cf5cd18f", "choice_type": "single"}, "correct": false, "pred": 2, "probs": [0.15278440713882446, 0.1731274127960205, 0.5009607672691345, 0.1731274127960205], "golden_prob": 0.15278440713882446, "pred_prob": 0.5009607672691345, "output": 0}
