These a chains are combined to form the various types of collagen found in the tissues. For example, the most common collagen, type I, contains two chains called a1 and one chain called a2 (a12a2)Ref: Lippincott's Illustrated Reviews: Biochemistry Fifth Edition Page no: 41", "cop": 1, "opa": "Type I", "opb": "Type II", "opc": "Type V", "opd": "Type VI", "subject_name": "Biochemistry", "topic_name": "Structure and function of protein", "id": "4b4a3053-2436-454c-9610-e7b3d657d624", "choice_type": "single"}, "correct": true, "pred": 0, "probs": [0.6732961535453796, 0.20534373819828033, 0.045818377286195755, 0.07554173469543457], "golden_prob": 0.6732961535453796, "pred_prob": 0.6732961535453796, "output": 0}

{"id": 67815, "question": "Which of the following is most common haemoglobinopathy", "choices": ["Thalassemia", "Sickle cell anemia", "Haemoglobin C", "Spherocytosis"], "answer": 1, "explanation": "On deoxygenation, HbS molecules form long polymers by means of intermolecular contacts that involve the abnormal valine residue at position 6. These polymers disto the red cell, which assumes an elongated crescentic, or sickle, shape (Fig. 11-3). The sickling of red cells initially is reversible upon reoxygenation. However, the distoion of the membrane that is produced by each sickling episode leads to an influx of calcium, which causes the loss of potassium and water and also damages the membrane skeleton. Over time, this cumu- lative damage creates irreversibly sickled cells, which are rapidly hemolyzed. Many variables influence the sickling of red cells in vivo. The three most impoant factors are * The presence of hemoglobins other than HbS. In heterozygotes approximately 40% of Hb is HbS and the remainder is HbA, which interacts only weakly with deox- ygenated HbS. Because the presence of HbA greatly retards the polymerization of HbS, the red cells of het- erozygotes have little tendency to sickle in vivo. Such persons are said to have sickle cell trait. HbC, another mutant b-globin, has a lysine residue instead of the normal glutamic acid residue at position 6. About 2.3% of Ameri- can blacks are heterozygous carriers of HbC; as a result, about 1 in 1250 newborns are compound heterozygotes for HbC and HbS. Because HbC has a greater tendency to aggregate with HbS than does HbA, HbS/HbC com- pound heterozygotes have a symptomatic sickling disorder called HbSC disease. HbF interacts weakly with HbS, so newborns with sickle cell anemia do not manifest the disease until HbF falls to adult levels, generally around the age of 5 to 6 months. * The intracellular concentration of HbS. The polyA merization of deoxygenated HbS is strongly concentration- dependent. Thus, red cell dehydration, which increases the Hb concentration, facilitates sickling. Conversely, the coexistence of a-thalassemia (described later), which decreases the Hb concentration, reduces sickling. The relatively low concentration of HbS also contributes to the absence of sickling in heterozygotes with sickle cell trait. * The transit time for red cells through the micro- vasculature. The normal transit times of red cells through capillaries are too sho for significant polymeriza- tion of deoxygenated HbS to occur. Hence, sickling in microvascular beds is confined to areas of the body in which blood flow is sluggish. This is the normal situation in the spleen and the bone marrow, two tissues promi- nently affected by sickle cell disease. Sickling also can be triggered in other microvascular beds by acquired factors that retard the passage of red cells. As described previ- ously, inflammation slows the flow of blood by increasing the adhesion of leukocytes and red cells to endothelium and by inducing the exudation of fluid through leaky vessels. In addition, sickle red cells have a greater tendency than normal red cells to adhere to endothelial cells, appar- ently because repeated bouts of sickling causes mem- brane damage that make them sticky. These factors conspire to prolong the transit times of sickle red cells, increasing the probability of clinically significant sickling. Two major consequences arise from the sickling of red cells (Fig. 11-4). First, the red cell membrane damage and dehydration caused by repeated episodes of sickling produce a chronic hemolytic anemia. The mean life span of red cells in sickle cell anemia is only 20 days (one sixth of normal). Second, red cell sickling produces widespread microvascular obstructions, which result in ischemic tissue damage and pain crises. Vaso-occlusion does not cor- relate with the number of irreversibly sickled cells and there- fore appears to result from factors such as infection, inflammation, dehydration, and acidosis that enhance the sickling of reversibly sickled cells. Ref Robbins 9/e pg 412", "raw": {"question": "Which of the following is most common haemoglobinopathy", "exp": "On deoxygenation, HbS molecules form long polymers by means of intermolecular contacts that involve the abnormal valine residue at position 6. These polymers disto the red cell, which assumes an elongated crescentic, or sickle, shape (Fig. 11-3). The sickling of red cells initially is reversible upon reoxygenation. However, the distoion of the membrane that is produced by each sickling episode leads to an influx of calcium, which causes the loss of potassium and water and also damages the membrane skeleton. Over time, this cumu- lative damage creates irreversibly sickled cells, which are rapidly hemolyzed. Many variables influence the sickling of red cells in vivo. The three most impoant factors are * The presence of hemoglobins other than HbS. In heterozygotes approximately 40% of Hb is HbS and the remainder is HbA, which interacts only weakly with deox- ygenated HbS. Because the presence of HbA greatly retards the polymerization of HbS, the red cells of het- erozygotes have little tendency to sickle in vivo. Such persons are said to have sickle cell trait. HbC, another mutant b-globin, has a lysine residue instead of the normal glutamic acid residue at position 6. About 2.3% of Ameri- can blacks are heterozygous carriers of HbC; as a result, about 1 in 1250 newborns are compound heterozygotes for HbC and HbS. Because HbC has a greater tendency to aggregate with HbS than does HbA, HbS/HbC com- pound heterozygotes have a symptomatic sickling disorder called HbSC disease. HbF interacts weakly with HbS, so newborns with sickle cell anemia do not manifest the disease until HbF falls to adult levels, generally around the age of 5 to 6 months. * The intracellular concentration of HbS. The polyA merization of deoxygenated HbS is strongly concentration- dependent. Thus, red cell dehydration, which increases the Hb concentration, facilitates sickling. Conversely, the coexistence of a-thalassemia (described later), which decreases the Hb concentration, reduces sickling. The relatively low concentration of HbS also contributes to the absence of sickling in heterozygotes with sickle cell trait. * The transit time for red cells through the micro- vasculature. The normal transit times of red cells through capillaries are too sho for significant polymeriza- tion of deoxygenated HbS to occur. Hence, sickling in microvascular beds is confined to areas of the body in which blood flow is sluggish. This is the normal situation in the spleen and the bone marrow, two tissues promi- nently affected by sickle cell disease. Sickling also can be triggered in other microvascular beds by acquired factors that retard the passage of red cells. As described previ- ously, inflammation slows the flow of blood by increasing the adhesion of leukocytes and red cells to endothelium and by inducing the exudation of fluid through leaky vessels. In addition, sickle red cells have a greater tendency than normal red cells to adhere to endothelial cells, appar- ently because repeated bouts of sickling causes mem- brane damage that make them sticky.

It transduces epizomes & plasmids also.- B'phages are viruses that parasitise bacteria & consist of nucleic acid core & a protein coat.- It is excellent tool for gene mapping of bacteria.Lysogenic conversion- Phage DNA becomes integrated with bacterial chromosome as prophage, which multiplies synchronously with host DNA & is transferred to daughter cells.-This is lysogeny & bacteria harbouring prophages are lypogenic bacteria. - In transduction phage acts as vehicle carrying bacteria genes from one cell to another but in lysogenic conversion phage DNA itself is new genetic element.Conjugation- Process where by 'male' or 'donor' bacteria mates or makes physical contact with female or recipient bacteria & transfer genetic element into it.Sexduction- Process of transfer of host genes through F factor resembles transduction known as sexduction.Conjugation, transduction, and transformation:Transfer procedureTransfer processTypes of cells involvedNature of DNA transferredConjugation:DNA transferred from 1 bacterium to anotherProkaryoticChromosomal or plasmidTransduction:DNA transferred by a virus from 1 cell to anotherProkaryoticAny gene in generalized transduction; only certain genes in specialized transductionTransformation:Purified DNA taken up by a cellProkaryotic or eukaryotic(e.g., human)Any DNA", "cop": 2, "opa": "Transformation", "opb": "Transduction", "opc": "Transcription", "opd": "Lysogenic conversion", "subject_name": "Microbiology", "topic_name": "General", "id": "6d64d2a2-b4b2-4db5-b367-21daf5e63ec7", "choice_type": "single"}, "correct": true, "pred": 1, "probs": [0.18083590269088745, 0.6718868613243103, 0.022990703582763672, 0.12428657710552216], "golden_prob": 0.6718868613243103, "pred_prob": 0.6718868613243103, "output": 1}

These are called defence mechanisms. Psychologists have identified a number of such defence mechanisms, which include the following 1. Rationalization: Instead of accepting failure and correcting himself, the individual tries to make excuses and justifies his behaviour. It is like the proverbial fox declaring that the grapes were sour, when it could not reach them. This is called rationalization. It is a face-saving device. 2. Projection: Sometimes the individual blames others for his mistakes or failures. It is just like the student saying that he could not score good marks in the examination because, his teacher did.not like him. 3. Compensation: Many people make use of compensation to enhance their self-esteem and prestige.

This is an example of which type of defence mechanism?", "exp": "DEFENCE MECHANISMS When an individual is faced with problems, difficulties or failures, he employs ceain ways or devices to achieve health, happiness or success. These are called defence mechanisms. Psychologists have identified a number of such defence mechanisms, which include the following 1. Rationalization: Instead of accepting failure and correcting himself, the individual tries to make excuses and justifies his behaviour. It is like the proverbial fox declaring that the grapes were sour, when it could not reach them. This is called rationalization. It is a face-saving device. 2. Projection: Sometimes the individual blames others for his mistakes or failures. It is just like the student saying that he could not score good marks in the examination because, his teacher did.not like him. 3. Compensation: Many people make use of compensation to enhance their self-esteem and prestige.

Standard adult treatment regimen for MB leprosy * Rifampicin: 600 mg once a month * Clofazimine: 300 mg once a month & 50 mg daily * Dapsone: 100 mg daily Duration: 12 months (12 blister packs) Follow up: once a year for 5 years Standard adult treatment regimen for PB leprosy * Rifampicin: 600 mg once a month * Dapsone: 100 mg daily Duration: six months (six blister packs) Follow up: once a year for 2 years Standard child (ages 10 - 14) treatment regimen for MB leprosy * Rifampicin: 450 mg once a month * Clofazimine: 150 mg once a month, and 50 mg every other day * Dapsone: 50 mg daily Duration: 12 months (12 blister packs) Follow up: once a year for 5 years Standard child (ages 10 - 14) treatment regimen for PB leprosy * Rifampicin: 450 mg once a month * Dapsone: 50 mg daily Duration: six months (six blister packs) Follow up: once a year for 5 years The appropriate dose for children under 10 years of age can be decided on the basis of body weight. [Rifampicin: 10 mg per kilogram body weight, clofazimine: 1 mg per kilogram per body tveight daily and 6 mg per kilogram monthly, dapsone: 2 mg per kilogram body weight daily. The standard child blister pack may be broken up so that the appropriate dose is given to children under 10 years of age. Clofazimine can be spaced out as required. **Rarely, it may be considered advisable to treat a patient with a high bacillary index (Bl) for more than 12 months. This decision may only be taken by specialists at referral units aftercareful consideration of the clinical and bacteriological evidence.

D: Celiac disease Celiac sprue/celiac disease/gluten-sensitive enteropathy is a chronic disease of the digestive tract that interferes with the digestion and absorption of food nutrients. People with celiac sprue cannot tolerate gliadin, the alcohol-soluble fraction of gluten. Gluten is a protein commonly found in wheat, rye, and barley. Most patients with celiac disease tolerate oats, but they should be monitored closely. When people with celiac sprue ingest gliadin, the mucosa of their intestines is damaged by an immunologically mediated inflammatory response, resulting in maldigestion and malabsorption. Patients with celiac disease can present with failure to thrive and diarrhea (the classical form). However, some patients have only subtle symptoms (atypical celiac disease) or are asymptomatic (silent celiac disease). Blood for specific screening tests should be drawn before the patient is placed on a gluten-free diet. Current screening tests include IgA antibodies to tissue transaminase, IgA/IgG antigliadin antibodies and IgA antiendomysial antibody. Combined presence of antiendomysial antibody and antigliadin antibody is almost predictive of intestinal mucosal atrophy but if both antibody tests are negative, mucosa is almost normal. Antiendomysial antibody screening is an excellent test for the diagnosis and follow-up of celiac disease and for identification of asymptomatic patients. Antiendomysial antibodies are highly specific but less sensitive than other antibodies. The absence of HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8 is useful for its high negative predictive value, but they are not helpful in confirming the diagnosis.

{"id": 151862, "question": "The most suitable agent for IV induction and maintenance in a day care surgery", "choices": ["Etomidate", "Ketamine", "Propofol", "Thiopentone"], "answer": 2, "explanation": "PROPOFOL The active ingredient in propofol, 2,6-diisopropylphenol, is essentially insoluble in aqueous solutions and is formulated only for IV administration as a 1% (10 mg/ml) emulsion in 10% soybean oil, 2.25% glycerol, and 1.2% purified egg phosphatide. In the United States, disodium EDTA (0.05 mg/ml) or sodium metabisulfite (0.25 mg/ml) is added to inhibit bacterial growth. The induction dose of propofol in a healthy adult is 1.5 to 2.5 mg/kg and it has an onset and duration of anesthesia similar to thiopental. As with barbiturates, dosages should be reduced in the elderly and in the presence of other sedatives and increased in young children. Because of its reasonably sho elimination half-life, propofol often is used for maintenance of anesthesia as well as for induction. For sho procedures, small boluses (10% to 50% of the induction dose) every 5 minutes or as needed are effective. An infusion of propofol produces a more stable drug level (100 to 300 mg/kg per minute) and is better suited for longer-term anesthetic maintenance. Infusion rates should be tailored to patient response and the levels of other hypnotics. Sedating doses of propofol are 20% to 50% of those required for general anesthesia. However, even at these lower doses, caregivers should be vigilant and prepared for all of the side effects of propofol discussed below, paicularly airway obstruction and apnea. Propofol elicits pain on injection that can be reduced with lidocaine and the use of larger arm and antecubital veins. Excitatory phenomena during induction with propofol occur at about the same frequency as with thiopental, but much less frequently than with methohexital. Side Effects: Nervous System: The CNS effects of propofol are similar to those of barbiturates. Propofol decreases CMRO2, cerebral blood flow, and intracranial and intraocular pressures by about the same amount as thiopental. Like thiopental, propofol has been used in patients at risk for cerebral ischemia; however, no human outcome studies have been performed to determine its efficacy as a neuroprotectant. Results from studies on the anticonvulsant effects of propofol have been mixed; some data even suggest it has proconvulsant activity when combined with other drugs. Thus, unlike thiopental, propofol is not a proven acute intervention for seizures. Cardiovascular. Propofol produces a dose-dependent decrease in blood pressure that is significantly greater than that produced by thiopental. The fall in blood pressure can be explained by both vasodilation and mild depression of myocardial contractility. Propofol appears to blunt the baroreceptor reflex or is directly vagotonic because smaller increases in hea rate are seen for any given drop in blood pressure after doses of propofol. As with thiopental, propofol should be used with caution in patients at risk for or intolerant of decreases in blood pressure. Respiratory and Other Side Effects: At equipotent doses, propofol produces a slightly greater degree of respiratory depression than thiopental. Patients given propofol should be monitored to ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation. Propofol appears to be less likely than barbiturates to provoke bronchospasm. It has no clinically significant effects on hepatic, renal, or endocrine organ systems. Unlike thiopental, propofol appears to have significant anti-emetic action and is a good choice for sedation or anesthesia of patients at high risk for nausea and vomiting. Propofol provokes anaphylactoid reactions and histamine release at about the same low frequency as thiopental.

About 48 hours after the ingestion of contaminated meal, patients present with abdominal pain and distention, vomiting, and passage of bloody stools. C. perfringens is also the most common cause of gas gangrene following wound infection or septic abortion. C. tetani (choice D) produces a potent neurotoxin that causes tetany and generalized muscle spasms. Clostridium botulinum (choice A) produces a neurotoxin that causes paralysis.Diagnosis: Pseudomembranous colitis, Clostridium difficile", "cop": 2, "opa": "Clostridium botulinum", "opb": "Clostridium difficile", "opc": "Clostridium perfringens", "opd": "Clostridium tetani", "subject_name": "Pathology", "topic_name": "Infectious Disease", "id": "30c6f2c3-1fd4-48bd-8592-27cf308b80d8", "choice_type": "single"}, "correct": true, "pred": 1, "probs": [0.03579840064048767, 0.7190300822257996, 0.14158542454242706, 0.1035861074924469], "golden_prob": 0.7190300822257996, "pred_prob": 0.7190300822257996, "output": 1}

The disease has three major features: (1) multiple neural tumors anywhere on or in the body (2) numerous pigmented cutaneous lesions (cafe au lait spots); and (3) pigmented iris hamaomas (Lisch nodules). Electron micrographic studies show that the tumors are the result of the proliferation of fibroblasts or Schwann cells in the peripheral nerves, possibly due to ras inactivation. There is no treatment, except for surgical resection of symptomatic tumors. Ependymoma can occur wherever ependymal cells are found. They are more common in children, and most often originate in the fouh ventricle. They are the most common intramedullary glioma of the spinal cord. Huntington disease, an autosomal dominant disorder, is characterized by severe degeneration of the caudate nucleus along with degenerative changes in the putamen and coex. In addition to chorea, these patients frequently suffer from athetoid movements, progressive dementia, and behavioral disorders. Marfan syndrome is due to a defect in the gene for fibrillin.

The disease has three major features: (1) multiple neural tumors anywhere on or in the body (2) numerous pigmented cutaneous lesions (cafe au lait spots); and (3) pigmented iris hamaomas (Lisch nodules). Electron micrographic studies show that the tumors are the result of the proliferation of fibroblasts or Schwann cells in the peripheral nerves, possibly due to ras inactivation. There is no treatment, except for surgical resection of symptomatic tumors. Ependymoma can occur wherever ependymal cells are found. They are more common in children, and most often originate in the fouh ventricle. They are the most common intramedullary glioma of the spinal cord. Huntington disease, an autosomal dominant disorder, is characterized by severe degeneration of the caudate nucleus along with degenerative changes in the putamen and coex. In addition to chorea, these patients frequently suffer from athetoid movements, progressive dementia, and behavioral disorders. Marfan syndrome is due to a defect in the gene for fibrillin.

For example, a patient with a left INO will have slowed or absent adducting movements of the left eye. Nystagmus is usually present in the abducted eye. Convergence is usually preserved unless the responsible lesion is high in the midbrain. A patient with bilateral injury to the medial longitudinal fasciculus will have bilateral INO. Multiple sclerosis is the most common cause, although tumor, stroke, trauma, or any brainstem process may be responsible. Ref: Hoon J.C. (2012). Chapter 28. Disorders of the Eye. In D.L. Longo, A.S.

Injury is due to friction. The surface of injury show irregular parallel lines, i.e., furrows or grooves. A violent lateral graze, due to rubbing of skin (as in dragging) is known as brush burn (Gravel rash). Friction burn (Scuff or brush abrasion) occur due to tangential contact with a smooth surface or when the skin is covered by clothing. It is an extensive superficial, reddened excoriated area without bleeding and with little or no linear mark. 3) Pressure abrasions (crushing or friction abrasions) : Though it is called friction abrasion, it results from pressure of the object on the body with no or little friction (it is a misnomer). It is caused by crushing of superficial epidermis due to inward directed movement of object at around 90deg to skin. Example are ligature marks in hanging/strangulation, teeth bites and nail marks. 4) Impact abrasion (Imprint or contact abrasion) : It is caused by impact (but not pressure) with a rough object, when the force is applied at or near 90deg to skin surface.

Other abdominal X ray features of volvulus are: Grossly distended inveed U shaped loop of sigmoid colon extending from the pelvis to the diaphragm with a curved inner colonic wall. RUQ pointing loop suggests sigmoid volvulus and LUQ pointing loop suggests cecal volvulus. Loss of haustral folds due to distention.

In fact, with the exception of infertility in klinefelter's sundrome, it is likely that most individuals with such trisomies may go undetected.TableNumerical chromosomal abnormalities includePolyploidye.g. triploidy = haploid x 3 (69XYY =23x3 common but lethal)AneuploidyAny chromosome number, which is not an exact multiple of haploid number e.g., Down syndrome 47 XY+ 21 or Klinefelter syndrome 47 XXY.TrisomyState of having three representatives of a given chromosome instead of the usual pair, as in trisomy 21 (Down syndrome).", "cop": 3, "opa": "Triploidy", "opb": "Monosomy", "opc": "Trisomy", "opd": "Aneuploidy", "subject_name": "Medicine", "topic_name": "Genetics", "id": "680fb3b1-12e9-4a6c-b3bd-c71bd109cc27", "choice_type": "single"}, "correct": true, "pred": 2, "probs": [0.013663696125149727, 0.039537213742733, 0.7460125088691711, 0.2007865458726883], "golden_prob": 0.7460125088691711, "pred_prob": 0.7460125088691711, "output": 2}

Exons RNA sequences in the primary transcript that are found in the mRNA. A TATA box is a DNA sequence that indicates the point at which a genetic sequence can be read and decoded. Transcription: Transcription is the process by which DNA is copied (transcribed) to mRNA, which carries the information needed for protein synthesis. Transcription takes place in two broad steps. First, pre-messenger RNA is formed, with the involvement of RNA polymerase enzymes. Second formation of Messenger RNA. Transcription unit: is a linear sequence of DNA that extends from a transcription sta site to a transcription stop site. The transcription unit--that poion of a gene that is copied by RNA polymerase--consists of coding regions of DNA (exons) interrupted by intervening sequences of noncoding DNA (introns). After transcription, during RNA processing, introns are removed and the exons are ligated together to form the mature mRNA that appears in the cytoplasm. 1) Transcription Steps: There are three main steps to the process of DNA transcription. Initiation: RNA Polymerase Binds to DNA. DNA is transcribed by an enzyme called RNA polymerase. Specific nucleotide sequences tell RNA polymerase where to begin and where to end. RNA polymerase attaches to the DNA at a specific area called the promoter region. Elongation: Ceain proteins called transcription factors unwind the DNA strand and allow RNA polymerase to transcribe only a single strand of DNA into a single stranded RNA polymer called messenger RNA (mRNA). The strand that serves as the template is called the antisense strand. The strand that is not transcribed is called the sense strand. Termination: RNA polymerase moves along the DNA until it reaches a terminator sequence. At that point, RNA polymerase releases the mRNA polymer and detaches from the DNA. 2) Pre mRNA processing: RNA splicing: pre-mRNAs typically include introns.Exons:are the continuous coding regions. Introns: are the noncoding intervening sequences.

C: Papilloedema ICP at rest is normally 7-15 mmHg for a supine adult, and becomes negative (averaging \"10 mmHg) in the veical position. Increased ICP One of the most damaging aspects of brain trauma and other conditions, directly correlated with poor outcome, is an elevated intracranial pressure. The body's response to a decrease in CPP is to raise blood pressure and dilate blood vessels in the brain. This results in increased cerebral blood volume, which increases ICP, lowering CPP fuher and causing a vicious cycle. Neurologic changes seen in increased ICP are mostly due to hypoxia and hypercapnea and are as follows: decreased LOC, Cheyne-Stokes respirations, hyperventilation, sluggish dilated pupils and widened pulse pressure. Signs and symptoms of increased ICP In general, symptoms and signs that suggest a rise in ICP including headache, nausea, vomiting, ocular palsies, altered level of consciousness, and papilledema. If papilledema is protracted, it may lead to visual disturbances, optic atrophy, and eventually blindness. In addition to the above, if mass effect is present with resulting displacement of brain tissue, additional signs may include pupillary dilatation, abducens (CrN VI) palsies, and the Cushing's triad.

(a) PCOS Ref : Shaws 15th ed. /115-116, Image- * GARLAND/NECKLACE pattern on USG: PCOS * Comet tail appearance: Adenomyomatosis * Snowstorm appearance: Choriocarcinoma Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), recently referred also as hyperandrogenic anovulation, is a chronic anovulation syndrome associated with androgen excess. The diagnosis is made on the combined clinical, biochemical and sonographic grounds. The revised 2003 ASRM/ESHRE Rotterdam consensus criteria 4 require two of the following three criteria for the diagnosis: oligo- or anovulation hyperandrogenism (clinical or biochemical) and follicle count on imaging As well as the exclusion of other aetiologies, such as congenital adrenal hyperplasia, Cushing syndrome and/or an androgen-secreting tumour. Subsequently, the Androgen Excess and PCOS society (AE-PCOS) 9 specified a similar set of criteria for diagnosing PCOS but added that PCOS should be seen primarily as a disorder of androgen excess or hyperandrogenism. The criteria set forward was: presence of hyperandrogenism (clinical and/or biochemical) ovarian dysfunction (oligo-anovulation and/or polycystic ovaries) exclusion of related disorders Terminology Hyperandrogenic anovulation has been proposed as more accurate and potentially less confusing term, as the ovarian feature is of multiple follicles and not cysts13. At this stage, however, PCOS remains the term that is widely known and used. Epidemiology The estimated prevalence is ~6% (range 4-8%) of women of reproductive age but this varies (up to 20%) depending on the diagnostic criteria used 11. Clinical presentation The classic triad of PCOS is: oligomenorrhea hirsutism obesity In addition to this, patients may have infertility, acne, male pattern balding or biochemically show increased androgen levels. Pathology Markers Luteinizing hormone (LH) is usually increased and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) can be normal or decreased 10. Normally premenopausal LH:FSH is 1:1. In PCOS it may be >2:1 or >3:1. Anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) levels are generally increased. Associations subfertility and recurrent pregnancy loss. long-term increased risk of type 2 diabetes cardiovascular disease endometrial cancer 6 women with polycystic ovarian morphology are at increased risk of OHSS when undergoing IVF, regardless of whether they have PCOS15 Radiographic features Ultrasound Current recommended sonographic criteria for multifollicular ovarian morphology: 25 or more follicles per ovary (superseding the earlier Rotterdam criteria of 12 or more follicles) 14 increased ovarian size (>10 cc): less sensitive than the follicle number criteria, but has a role when image resolution does not allow accurate follicle count, e.g. transabdominal scanning, older equipment Other morphological features include: hyperechoic central stroma peripheral location of follicles: which can give a string of pearl appearance follicles of similar size measuring 2-9 mm The presence of a single multifollicular ovary is sufficient to provide the sonographic criterion for PCOS2. Ovaries may be normal in PCOS, and conversely, polycystic ovaries may be seen in women without the syndrome. Diagnosis requires correlation with features of hyperandrogenism and oligo-anovulation. MRI MRI is not warranted routinely in the investigation of PCOS, nonetheless pelvic MRI may show most or all of the above sonographic features. Signal characteristics include: T1: small uniform follicles are low in signal while the central stroma is of intermediate signal (vs normal myometrium) T2: follicles have high T2 signal while the central stroma is of comparatively low T2 signal 8 Practical points with a lack of consensus sometimes it is easier to report the number of follicles in each ovary rather than attempt to label the ovaries as \"polycystic\" or \"multifollicular\" History and etymology The syndrome was first described by I.F.

The criteria set forward was: presence of hyperandrogenism (clinical and/or biochemical) ovarian dysfunction (oligo-anovulation and/or polycystic ovaries) exclusion of related disorders Terminology Hyperandrogenic anovulation has been proposed as more accurate and potentially less confusing term, as the ovarian feature is of multiple follicles and not cysts13. At this stage, however, PCOS remains the term that is widely known and used. Epidemiology The estimated prevalence is ~6% (range 4-8%) of women of reproductive age but this varies (up to 20%) depending on the diagnostic criteria used 11. Clinical presentation The classic triad of PCOS is: oligomenorrhea hirsutism obesity In addition to this, patients may have infertility, acne, male pattern balding or biochemically show increased androgen levels. Pathology Markers Luteinizing hormone (LH) is usually increased and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) can be normal or decreased 10. Normally premenopausal LH:FSH is 1:1. In PCOS it may be >2:1 or >3:1. Anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) levels are generally increased. Associations subfertility and recurrent pregnancy loss. long-term increased risk of type 2 diabetes cardiovascular disease endometrial cancer 6 women with polycystic ovarian morphology are at increased risk of OHSS when undergoing IVF, regardless of whether they have PCOS15 Radiographic features Ultrasound Current recommended sonographic criteria for multifollicular ovarian morphology: 25 or more follicles per ovary (superseding the earlier Rotterdam criteria of 12 or more follicles) 14 increased ovarian size (>10 cc): less sensitive than the follicle number criteria, but has a role when image resolution does not allow accurate follicle count, e.g. transabdominal scanning, older equipment Other morphological features include: hyperechoic central stroma peripheral location of follicles: which can give a string of pearl appearance follicles of similar size measuring 2-9 mm The presence of a single multifollicular ovary is sufficient to provide the sonographic criterion for PCOS2. Ovaries may be normal in PCOS, and conversely, polycystic ovaries may be seen in women without the syndrome. Diagnosis requires correlation with features of hyperandrogenism and oligo-anovulation. MRI MRI is not warranted routinely in the investigation of PCOS, nonetheless pelvic MRI may show most or all of the above sonographic features. Signal characteristics include: T1: small uniform follicles are low in signal while the central stroma is of intermediate signal (vs normal myometrium) T2: follicles have high T2 signal while the central stroma is of comparatively low T2 signal 8 Practical points with a lack of consensus sometimes it is easier to report the number of follicles in each ovary rather than attempt to label the ovaries as \"polycystic\" or \"multifollicular\" History and etymology The syndrome was first described by I.F.

Because MHC molecules are fundamental to the recognition of antigens by T cells and are linked to many autoimmune diseases. In humans the MHC molecules are called human leukocyte antigens (HLA).

Class I MHC molecules display peptides that are derived from proteins, such as viral and tumor antigens, that are located in the cytoplasm and usually produced in the cell, and class I-associated peptides are recognized by CD8+ T lymphocytes. Since CD8+ T cells recognize peptides only if presented as a complex with class I MHC molecules, CD8+ T cells are said to be class I MHC-restricted. * Class II MHC molecules- encoded in a region called HLA-D, which has three subregions: HLA-DP, HLA-DQ, and HLA-DR.

Bailey and Love 26th/pg. 1378).Undescended testis# Testes that are absent from the scrotum after three months of age are unlikely to descend# Histological changes in the testis can be seen from one year of age# An incompletely descended testis tends to atrophy as puberty approaches# Boys with undescended testes are at greater risk of infertility, testicular malignancy (esp seminoma), hernia and testicular torsion.Retractile testis# Retractile testes should be differentiated from true undescended testes# Retractile testes are more common than true undescended testes# Retractile testes require no treatmentINCOMPLETELY DESCENDED TESTISDefinition: Incomplete descent of the testis occurs when the testis is arrested in some part of its normal path to the scrotum. An ectopic testis is a testis that is abnormally placed outside this path.Incidence: About 4 % of boys are bom with one or both testes incompletely descended. About two thirds of these reach the scrotum during the first three months of life, but full descent after that is uncommon. The incidence of testicular maldescent at the age of one year is around 1 %. In 10 % of unilateral cases, there is a family history.Pathology: The condition is more common on the right and is bilateral in 20 % of cases. In adults, secondary sexual characteristics are typically normal.The testis may be:# intra-abdominal; usually lying extraperitoneally just inside the internal inguinal ring;# intra-canalicular; it may or may not be palpable;# extra-canalicular; usually at the scrotal neck;# ectopic; the most common site is within the superficial inguinal pouch which lies just inferior and medial to the superficial inguinal ring. Other rarer ectopic sites include the femoral triangle, the root of the penis and perineum.Useful investigations include:# laparoscopy-theoptimummethodofvisualisingtheanatomy;# ultrasound scan - this has a limited role in detecting an inguinal testis in an obese boy;# hormonal-in cases of bilateral impalpable testes, the presence of testicular tissue can be confirmed by recording a rise in serum testosterone in response to intramuscular injections of human chorionic gonadotrophin; these boys require specialist endocrine review.Consequences:Infertility, Malignancy (The most common cancer is a seminoma and, as with fertility, it is unclear whether early orchidopexy reduces the risk of malignancy.), Hernia, Testicular torsion.# Rx: Orchidopexy: usually performed before the boy reaches 12 months of age in an attempt to prevent the consequences. Orchidectomy is often advised for the unilateral intra-abdominal testis, which cannot be corrected by orchidopexy because of the future risk of malignancy. In cases of bilateral intra-abdominal testes, microvascular transfer and staged orchidopexy are two options available to preserve the testes if the testicular vessels are too short to permit a single-stage orchidopexy.In undescended testis, seminoma is the malignany most likely to develop if at all. Seminomas are radiosensitive and excellent results have been obtained by irradiating stage 1 and stage 2 tumours. More recently, the tumour has been shown to be highly sensitive to cisplatin, which is already being used for patients with metastatic disease.

The essential feature of HCM is massive myocardial hyperophy,usually without ventricular dilation. The classic pattern involves dispropoionate thickening of the ventricularseptum relative to the left ventricle free wall (with a ratio of septum to free wall greater than 3 : 1), termed asymmetric septal hyperophy. In about 10% of cases, the hyperophy is concentric and symmetrical. On longitudinal sectioning, the normally round-to-ovoid left ventricular cavity may be compressed into a \"banana-like\" configuration by bulging of the ventricular septum into the lumen. Although marked hyperophy can involve the entire septum, it is usually most prominent in the subaoic region.

The essential feature of HCM is massive myocardial hyperophy,usually without ventricular dilation. The classic pattern involves dispropoionate thickening of the ventricularseptum relative to the left ventricle free wall (with a ratio of septum to free wall greater than 3 : 1), termed asymmetric septal hyperophy. In about 10% of cases, the hyperophy is concentric and symmetrical. On longitudinal sectioning, the normally round-to-ovoid left ventricular cavity may be compressed into a \"banana-like\" configuration by bulging of the ventricular septum into the lumen. Although marked hyperophy can involve the entire septum, it is usually most prominent in the subaoic region.

EndocervixCervical secretions become thick and viscid.Ferning pattern disappears.(C). VaginaVaginal epithelium becomes thickened, cornified and infiltrated by leukocytes.(D). Fallopian TubesIncreases the heating rate of cilia of fallopian tubes towards uterus.Increased epithelial cell secretion.Secretions are rich in nutritive materials to provide nutrition to shedded ovum and zygote.(E).

EndocervixCervical secretions become thick and viscid.Ferning pattern disappears.(C). VaginaVaginal epithelium becomes thickened, cornified and infiltrated by leukocytes.(D). Fallopian TubesIncreases the heating rate of cilia of fallopian tubes towards uterus.Increased epithelial cell secretion.Secretions are rich in nutritive materials to provide nutrition to shedded ovum and zygote.(E). BreastCauses lobular and alveolar growth.(F). During PregnancyMaintains pregnancy.Non-Reproductive Actions(A). Thermogenic EffectProgesterone is thermogenic steroid.Increases basal body temperature by 0.5 deg in postovulatory phase.(B). CMSAlters secretion and release of various NT in Hypothalamus.Decreases appetite and produces somnolence.(C). RespirationIncreases sensitivity of the respiratory centre to C02 stimulation.PACO 2 is slightly less in women during luteal phase.Progesterone is tried in Pickwickian syndrome.(D).

All pregnant women should have HIV testing at an early stage in pregnancy. The CD4 count falls by about 25% during pregnancy due to haemodilution. The course of HIV disease progression is not altered by pregnancy. In the pre-A era, the rate of mother-to-child transmission was 15-40%, with rates being influenced by several factors .A has dramatically reduced the risk of mother-to-child transmission of HIV to less than 1%. All pregnant women should sta A at the beginning of the second trimester, unless they have advanced disease, when A should be staed in the first trimester. Caesarean section is associated with a lower risk of mother- to-child transmission than vaginal delivery, but the mode of delivery does not affect transmission risk if the viral load is suppressed on A. HIV is also transmitted by breastfeeding. In high-income countries, exclusive formula feeding is generally recommended. In resource-poor settings, however, formula feeding is associated with a risk of infant morbidity and moality, which may negate the benefit of not transmitting HIV to the infant. There is minimal risk of transmitting HIV by breastfeeding in women with a suppressed viral load on A. Fuhermore, providing antiretrovirals to infants (usually nevirapine monotherapy) while they are breastfeeding has been shown to reduce the risk of transmission. Breastfeeding is therefore now encouraged in resource-poor settings. Infants should be exclusively breastfed for the first 6 months, as mixed feeding (with formula or solids) is associated with a higher risk of transmission. Diagnosis of HIV in infancy requires the detection of HIV RNA by PCR, as maternal antibodies to HIV, which persist for up to 15 months, will give a false-positive result on antibody assays.

The gaps formed between myelin sheath cells along the axons are called nodes of Ranvier. Since the lipid structure of myelin serves as a good insulator, the myelin sheaths increase the rate of propagation and efficacy of transmission of the impulse along the axon. The electrical impulse jumps from one node to the next at the rate as fast as 120 m/s. This rapid type of conduction is called saltatory conduction. Demyelination can occur early in life as consequence of congenital metabolic disorders. Demyelination later in life can be repaired with glia, which explains the frequent exacerbations and remissions in MS. It is believed that in MS, multiple mechanisms of immune injury of myelin coexist: cytokine-mediated injury of oligodendrocytes and myelin, digestion of surface myelin antigens by macrophages, complement-mediated injury, and direct injury by CD4+ and CD8+ T cells.

A single oral intrapartum dose of 200 mg nevirapine followed by a single dose given to the newborn reduced neonatal infection by 13% compared with 21.5% infection with a more complicated zidovudine regimen, as studied by Sheran and co-workers in 2005.

However, a causal role for herpes simplex virus in Bell's palsy is unproven.Differential Diagnosis# Tumors that invade the temporal bone (carotid body, cholesteatoma, dermoid).# The Ramsay Hunt syndrome, presumably due to herpes zoster of the geniculate ganglion, consists of a severe facial palsy associated with a vesicular eruption in the pharynx, external auditory canal, and other parts of the cranial integument; often the eighth cranial nerve is affected as well.# Acoustic neuromas frequently involve the facial nerve by local compression.# Infarcts, demyelinating lesions of multiple sclerosis, and tumors are the common pontine lesions that interrupt the facial nerve fibers; other signs of brainstem involvement are usually present.# Bilateral facial paralysis (facial diplegia) occurs in Guillain-Barre' syndrome and also in a form of sarcoidosis known as uveoparotid fever (Heerfordt syndrome).# Lyme disease is a frequent cause of facial palsies in endemic areas.# The rare Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome consists of a triad of recurrent facial paralysis, recurrent--and eventually permanent--facial (particularly labial) edema, and less constantly, plication of the tongue;# Leprosy frequently involves the facial nerve, and facial neuropathy may also occur in diabetes mellitus.# All these forms of nuclear or peripheral facial palsy must be distinguished from the supranuclear type.# In the latter, the frontalis and orbicularis oculi muscles are involved less than those of the lower part of the face, since the upper facial muscles are innervated by corticobulbar pathways from both motor cortices, whereas the lower facial muscles are innervated only by the opposite hemisphere.Treatment# Symptomatic measures include use of paper tape to depress the upper eyelid during sleep and prevent corneal drying, and Massage of the weakened muscles.# A course of glucocorticoids, given as prednisone 60 to 80 mg daily during the first 5 days and then tapered over the next 5 days, appears to shorten the recovery period and modestly improve the functional outcome.# In one double-blind study, patients treated within 3 days of onset with both prednisone and acyclovir (400 mg five times daily for 10 days) had a better outcome than patients treated with prednisone alone.", "raw": {"question": "Nerve involved in Bell's palsy is", "exp": "Ans. a (Facial nerve).

Hereditary spherocytosis is caused by abnormalities in the membrane skeleton, a network of proteins that underlies lipid bilayer of the red cell (Fig. 11-1). The major membrane skeleton protein is spectrin, a long, flexible het- erodimer that self-associates at one end and binds sho actin filaments at its other end. These contacts create a two- dimensional meshwork that is linked to the overlying mem- brane through ankyrin and band 4.2 to the intrinsic membrane protein called band 3, and through band 4.1 to glycophorin. The mutations in hereditary spherocytosis most frequently involve ankyrin, band 3, and spectrin, but mutations in other components of the skeleton have also been described.A shared feature of the pathogenic mutations is that they weaken the veical interactions between the membrane skeleton and the intrinsic membrane proteins. This defect somehow destabilizes the lipid bilayer of the red cells, which shed membrane vesicles into the cir- culation as they age. Little cytoplasm is lost in the process and as a result the surface area to volume ratio decreases progressively over time until the cells become spherical (Fig. 11-1). The spleen plays a major role in the destruction of sphe- rocytes. Red cells must undergo extreme degrees of defor- mation to pass through the splenic cords. The floppy discoid shape of normal red cells allows considerable latitude for shape changes. By contrast, spherocytes have limited deform- ability and are sequestered in the splenic cords, where they are destroyed by the plentiful resident macrophages. The critical role of the spleen is illustrated by the beneficial effect of splenectomy; although the red cell defect and spherocytes persist, the anemia is corrected.

Proposed causes include the following:Arteriosclerosis:Diabetes accelerates the process of atherosclerosis, diffuse proliferation and hypertrophy of the vascular intimal endothelium and brainstem neuropathyDiets high in antioxidants such as vitamins C and E reduce the progression of presbycusisAccumulated exposure to noiseDrug and environmental chemical exposureStressGeneticsInvestigations: Audiometric testing with pure-tone average and speech discrimination forms the cornerstone of diagnostic testing for presbycusis. Based upon audiometry and histopathology presbycusis is classified asTypeAudiometry SensorypresbycusisSharply down-sloping bilateral symmetrical sensorineural hearing loss. Higher frequencies are affected but speech discrimination remains good.Degeneration of the organ of corti, starting at the basal coil and progressing gradually to the apex.NeuralpresbycusisSlowly descending audiometric pattern, worse in the high frequencies, and a significant decrements in speech discrimination.Degeneration of the coils of spiral ganglion, starting at the basal coil and progressing to the apex.Strial or metabolicAudiomety is flat but speech discrimination is good.Atrophy of the stria vascularis in all turns of cochleaCochlearconductiveSloping type audiogramThis is due to stiffening of the basilar membrane thus affecting its movementsTreatment: Patients of presbycusis can be helped by a hearing aid. They should also have lessons in speech reading through visual cues. Curtailment of smoking and stimulants like tea and coffee may help to decrease tinnitus.", "cop": 2, "opa": "Normal study", "opb": "Sensory neural hearing loss", "opc": "Conductive hearing loss", "opd": "Mixed hearing loss", "subject_name": "ENT", "topic_name": "Ear", "id": "a473ce81-de7f-488b-be1d-ea76b17de0ef", "choice_type": "single"}, "correct": true, "pred": 1, "probs": [0.06066160649061203, 0.6521736979484558, 0.047243304550647736, 0.23992130160331726], "golden_prob": 0.6521736979484558, "pred_prob": 0.6521736979484558, "output": 1}
