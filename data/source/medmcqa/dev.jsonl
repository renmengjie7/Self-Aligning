Lateral LemniscusThe spiral ganglion houses the cell bodies of the first order neurons. These neurons receive information from hair cells in the Organ of Corti and travel within the osseous spiral lamina. Their central axons form the main component of the cochlear nerve. Fibers from the cochlear nerve send information to the cochlear nuclei on each side of the brainstem. Fibers from cochlear nuclei neurons decussate at the trapezoid body and some fibers synapse at the ipsiloteral superior olivary nucleus. The superior olivary nucleus is located just next to the trapezoid body. It projects upwards through the lateral lemniscus.Fibers ascending through the lateral lemniscus from both cochlear nuclei and from the superior olivary nuclei arrive at the inferior colliculus, where all these fibers carrying auditory information converge.These fibers project to the ipsilateral medial geniculate body (MGB) in the thalamus (recall that vision is relayed on the lateral geniculate body).", "raw": {"question": "Auditory transmission is via:", "exp": "Ans.
